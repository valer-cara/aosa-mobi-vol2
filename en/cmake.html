<p>In 1999 the National Library of Medicine engaged a small company
called Kitware to develop a better way to configure, build, and deploy
complex software across many different platforms. This work was part
of the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit, or
ITK<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>.  Kitware, the engineering
lead on the project, was tasked with developing a build system that
the ITK researchers and developers could use. The system had to be
easy to use, and allow for the most productive use of the researchers'
programming time. Out of this directive emerged CMake as a replacement
for the aging autoconf/libtool approach to building software.  It was
designed to address the weaknesses of existing tools while maintaining
their strengths.</p>

<p>In addition to a build system, over the years CMake has evolved into a
family of development tools: CMake, CTest, CPack, and CDash. CMake is
the build tool responsible for building software. CTest is a test
driver tool, used to run regression tests. CPack is a packaging tool
used to create platform-specific installers for software built with
CMake. CDash is a web application for displaying testing results and
performing continuous integration testing.</p>

<h2>5.1. CMake History and Requirements</h2>

<p>When CMake was being developed, the normal practice for a project was
to have a configure script and Makefiles for Unix platforms, and
Visual Studio project files for Windows. This duality of build systems
made cross-platform development very tedious for many projects: the
simple act of adding a new source file to a project was painful. The
obvious goal for developers was to have a single unified build system.
The developers of CMake had experience with two approaches of solving
the unified build system problem.</p>

<p>One approach was the VTK build system of 1999.  That system consisted
of a configure script for Unix and an executable called <code>pcmaker</code>
for Windows. <code>pcmaker</code> was a C program that read in Unix
Makefiles and created NMake files for Windows.  The binary executable
for <code>pcmaker</code> was checked into the VTK CVS system repository.  Several
common cases, like adding a new library, required changing that source
and checking in a new binary.
Although this was a unified system in some sense, it had many
shortcomings.</p>

<p>The other approach the developers had experience with was a
<code>gmake</code> based build system for TargetJr.  TargetJr was a C++
computer vision environment originally developed on Sun
workstations. Originally TargetJr used the <code>imake</code> system to
create Makefiles. However, at some point, when a Windows port was
needed, the <code>gmake</code> system was created. Both Unix compilers and
Windows compilers could be used with this <code>gmake</code>-based system.
The system required several environment variables to be set prior to
running <code>gmake</code>.  Failure to have the correct environment caused
the system to fail in ways that were difficult to debug, especially
for end users.</p>

<p>Both of these systems suffered from a serious flaw: they forced
Windows developers to use the command line. Experienced Windows
developers prefer to use integrated development environments (IDEs).
This would encourage Windows developers to create IDE files by hand
and contribute them to the project, creating the dual build system
again.  In addition to the lack of IDE support, both of the systems
described above made it extremely difficult to combine software
projects. For example, <a href="vtk.html">VTK</a> had very few modules for reading images
mostly because the build system made it very difficult to use
libraries like libtiff and libjpeg.</p>

<p>It was decided that a new build system would be developed for ITK and
C++ in general. The basic constraints of the new build system would be
as follows:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Depend only on a C++ compiler being installed on the system.</li>

  <li>It must be able to generate Visual Studio IDE input files.</li>

  <li>It must be easy to create the basic build system targets,
    including static libraries, shared libraries, executables, and
    plugins.</li>

  <li>It must be able to run build time code generators.</li>

  <li>It must support separate build trees from the source tree.</li>

  <li>It must be able to perform system introspection, i.e.,
    be able to determine automatically what the target system
    could and could not do.</li>

  <li>It must do dependency scanning of C/C++ header files
    automatically.</li>

  <li>All features would need to work consistently and equally well
    on all supported platforms.</li>

</ul>

<p>In order to avoid depending on any additional libraries and parsers,
CMake was designed with only one major dependency, the C++ compiler
(which we can safely assume we have if we're building C++ code). At the
time, building and installing scripting languages like Tcl was difficult
on many popular UNIX and Windows systems. It can still be an
issue today on modern supercomputers and secured computers with no
Internet connection, so it can still be difficult to build third-party
libraries. Since the build
system is such a basic requirement for a package, it was decided that no
additional dependencies would be introduced into CMake. This
did limit CMake to creating its own simple language, which is a choice
that still causes some people to dislike CMake. However, at the time
the most popular embedded language was Tcl. If CMake had been a
Tcl-based build system, it is unlikely that it would have gained the
popularity that it enjoys today.</p>

<p>The ability to generate IDE project files is a strong selling point
for CMake, but it also limits CMake to providing only the features
that the IDE can support natively.  However, the benefits of providing
native IDE build files outweigh the limitations.  Although this
decision made the development of CMake more difficult, it made the
development of ITK and other projects using CMake much easier.
Developers are happier and more productive when using the tools they
are most familiar with.  By allowing developers to use their preferred
tools, projects can take best advantage of their most important
resource: the developer.</p>

<p>All C/C++ programs require one or more of the following fundamental
building blocks of software: executables, static libraries, shared
libraries, and plugins. CMake had to provide the ability to create
these products on all supported platforms. Although all platforms
support the creation of those products, the compiler flags used to
create them vary greatly from compiler to compiler and platform to
platform.  By hiding the complexity and platform differences behind a
simple command in CMake, developers are able to create them on
Windows, Unix and Mac. This ability allows developers to focus on the
project rather than on the details of how to build a shared library.</p>

<p>Code generators provide added complexity to a build system.  From the
start, VTK provided a system that automatically wrapped the
C++ code into Tcl, Python, and Java by
parsing the C++ header files, and automatically generating a wrapping
layer.  This requires a build system that can build a C/C++ executable
(the wrapper generator), then run that executable at build time to
create more C/C++ source code (the wrappers for the particular
modules).  That generated source code must then be compiled into
executables or shared libraries. All of this has to happen within the
IDE environments and the generated Makefiles.</p>

<p>When developing flexible cross-platform C/C++ software, it is
important to program to the features of the system, and not to the
specific system. Autotools has a model for doing system introspection
which involves compiling small snippets of code, inspecting and
storing the results of that compile. Since CMake was meant to be
cross-platform it adopted a similar system introspection technique.
This allows developers to program to the canonical system instead of
to specific systems. This is important to make future portability
possible, as compilers and operating systems change over time.  For
example, code like this:</p>

<pre>
#ifdef linux
// do some linux stuff
#endif
</pre>

<p class="continue">Is more brittle than code like this:</p>

<pre>
#ifdef HAS_FEATURE
// do something with a feature
#endif
</pre>

<p>Another early CMake requirement also came from autotools: the ability
to create build trees that are separate from the source tree. This
allows for multiple build types to be performed on the same source
tree. It also prevents the source tree from being cluttered with build
files, which often confuses version control systems.</p>

<p>One of the most important features of a build system is the ability to
manage dependencies. If a source file is changed, then all products
using that source file must be rebuilt. For C/C++ code, the header
files included by a <code>.c</code> or <code>.cpp</code> file must also be checked
as part of the dependencies.  Tracking down issues where only some of
the code that should be compiled actually gets compiled as a result of
incorrect dependency information can be time consuming.</p>

<p>All of the requirements and features of the new build system had to
work equally well on all supported platforms. CMake needed to provide
a simple API for developers to create complicated software systems
without having to understand platform details. In effect, software
using CMake is outsourcing the build complications to the CMake
team. Once the vision for the build tool was created with the basic
set of requirements, implementation needed to proceed in an agile way.
ITK needed a build system almost from day one. The first versions of
CMake did not meet all of the requirements set out in the vision, but
they were able to build on Windows and Unix.</p>

<h2>5.2. How CMake Is Implemented</h2>

<p>As mentioned, CMake's development languages are C and C++. To explain
its internals this section will first describe the CMake process from
a user's point of view, then examine its structures.</p>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>5.2.1. The CMake Process</h3>

<p>CMake has two main phases. The first is the "configure" step, in which
CMake processes all the input given to it and creates an internal
representation of the build to be performed. Then next phase is the
"generate" step. In this phase the actual build files are created.</p>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Environment Variables (or Not)</h4>

<p>In many build systems in 1999, and even today, shell level environment
variables are used during the build of a project. It is typical that a
project has a PROJECT_ROOT environment variable that points to the
location of the root of the source tree.  Environment variables are
also used to point to optional or external packages. The trouble with
this approach is that for the build to work, all of these external
variables need to be set each time a build is performed. To solve this
problem CMake has a cache file that stores all of the variables
required for a build in one place. These are not shell or environment
variables, but CMake variables. The first time CMake is run for a
particular build tree, it creates a <code>CMakeCache.txt</code> file which
stores all the persistent variables for that build. Since the file is
part of the build tree, the variables will always be available to
CMake during each run.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>The Configure Step</h4>

<p>During the configure step, CMake first reads the <code>CMakeCache.txt</code>
if it exists from a prior run.  It then reads <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>,
found in the root of the source tree given to CMake. During the
configure step, the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> files are parsed by the
CMake language parser. Each of the CMake commands found in the file is
executed by a command pattern object. Additional <code>CMakeLists.txt</code>
files can be parsed
during this step by the <code>include</code> and <code>add_subdirectory</code>
CMake commands.
CMake has a C++ object for each of the commands that can be used in
the CMake language. Some examples of commands are <code>add_library</code>,
<code>if</code>, <code>add_executable</code>, <code>add_subdirectory</code>, and
<code>include</code>. In effect, the entire language of CMake is implemented
as calls to commands. The parser simply converts the CMake input files
into command calls and lists of strings that are arguments to
commands.</p>

<p>The configure step essentially "runs" the user-provided CMake
code. After all of the code is executed, and all cache variable values
have been computed, CMake has an in-memory representation of the
project to be built. This will include all of the libraries,
executables, custom commands, and all other information required to
create the final build files for the selected generator. At this
point, the <code>CMakeCache.txt</code> file is saved to disk for use in
future runs of CMake.</p>

<p>The in-memory representation of the project is a collection of
targets, which are simply things that may be built, such as
libraries and executables. CMake also supports custom
targets: users can define their inputs and outputs, and provide
custom executables or scripts to be run at build time. CMake
stores each target in a <code>cmTarget</code> object. These objects are
stored in turn in the <code>cmMakefile</code> object, which is basically a
storage place for all of the targets found in a given directory of the
source tree. The end result is a tree of <code>cmMakefile</code> objects
containing maps of <code>cmTarget</code> objects.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>The Generate Step</h4>

<p>Once the configure step has been completed, the generate step can take
place. The generate step is when CMake creates the build files for the
target build tool selected by the user. At this point the internal
representation of targets (libraries, executables, custom targets) is
converted to either an input to an IDE build tool like Visual Studio,
or a set of Makefiles to be executed by <code>make</code>. CMake's internal
representation after the configure step is as generic as possible so
that as much code and data structures as possible can be shared
between different built tools.</p>

<p>An overview of the process can be seen in <a href="#fig.cma.pro">Figure&nbsp;5.1</a>.</p>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>5.2.2. CMake: The Code</h3>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>CMake Objects</h4>

<p>CMake is an object-oriented system using inheritance, design patterns
and encapsulation.  The major C++ objects and their relationships can
be seen in <a href="#fig.cma.obj">Figure&nbsp;5.2</a>.</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig.cma.obj">
  <img src="../images/cmake/objects.png" alt="[CMake Objects]" />
  <p>Figure&nbsp;5.2: CMake Objects</p>
</div>

<p>The results of parsing each <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file are stored in
the <code>cmMakefile</code> object. In addition to storing the information
about a directory, the <code>cmMakefile</code> object controls the parsing
of the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file. The parsing function calls an
object that uses a lex/yacc-based parser for the CMake language.
Since the CMake language syntax changes very infrequently, and lex and yacc
are not always available on systems where CMake is being built, the
lex and yacc output files are processed and stored in the
<code>Source</code> directory under version control with all of the other
handwritten files.</p>

<p>Another important class in CMake is <code>cmCommand</code>. This is the base
class for the implementation of all commands in the CMake
language. Each subclass not only provides the implementation for the
command, but also its documentation. As an example, see the
documentation methods on the <code>cmUnsetCommand</code> class:</p>

<pre>
virtual const char* GetTerseDocumentation()
{
    return "Unset a variable, cache variable, or environment variable.";
}

/**
 * More documentation.
 */

virtual const char* GetFullDocumentation()
{
    return
      "  unset(&lt;variable&gt; [CACHE])\n"
      "Removes the specified variable causing it to become undefined.  "
      "If CACHE is present then the variable is removed from the cache "
      "instead of the current scope.\n"
      "&lt;variable&gt; can be an environment variable such as:\n"
      "  unset(ENV{LD_LIBRARY_PATH})\n"
      "in which case the variable will be removed from the current "
      "environment.";
}
</pre>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Dependency Analysis</h4>

<p>CMake has powerful built-in dependency analysis capabilities for
individual Fortran, C and C++ source code files. Since Integrated
Development Environments (IDEs) support and maintain file dependency
information, CMake skips this step for those build systems. For IDE
builds, CMake creates a native IDE input file, and lets the IDE handle
the file level dependency information. The target level dependency information
is translated to the IDE's format for specifying dependency information.</p>

<p>With Makefile-based builds, native make programs do not know how to
automatically compute and keep dependency information up-to-date. For
these builds, CMake automatically computes dependency information for
C, C++ and Fortran files. Both the generation and maintenance of these
dependencies are automatically done by CMake. Once a project is
initially configured by CMake, users only need to run <code>make</code> and
CMake does the rest of the work.</p>

<p>Although users do not need to know how CMake does this work, it may be
useful to look at the dependency information files for a project. This
information for each target is stored in four files called
<code>depend.make</code>, <code>flags.make</code>, <code>build.make</code>, and
<code>DependInfo.cmake</code>.  <code>depend.make</code> stores the dependency
information for all the object files in the directory.
<code>flags.make</code> contains the compile flags used for the source files
of this target. If they change then the files will be recompiled.
<code>DependInfo.cmake</code> is used to keep the dependency information
up-to-date and contains information about what files are part of the
project and what languages they are in. Finally, the rules for
building the dependencies are stored in <code>build.make</code>. If a
dependency for a target is out of date then the depend information
for that target will be recomputed, keeping the dependency information
current. This is done because a change to a .h file could add a new
dependency.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>CTest and CPack</h4>

<p>Along the way, CMake grew from a build system into
a family of tools for building, testing, and packaging
software. In addition to command line <code>cmake</code>, and the CMake GUI
programs, CMake ships with a testing tool CTest, and a packaging tool
CPack. CTest and CPack shared the same code base as CMake, but are
separate tools not required for a basic build.</p>

<p>The <code>ctest</code> executable is used to run regression tests. A project
can easily create tests for CTest to run with the <code>add_test</code>
command. The tests can be run with CTest, which can also be used to
send testing results to the CDash application for viewing on the web.
CTest and CDash together are similar to the Hudson testing tool. They
do differ in one major area: CTest is designed to allow a much more
distributed testing environment.  Clients can be setup to pull source
from version control system, run tests, and send the results to
CDash. With Hudson, client machines must give Hudson ssh access to the
machine so tests can be run.</p>

<p>The <code>cpack</code> executable is used to create installers for
projects. CPack works much like the build part of CMake: it interfaces
with other packaging tools. For example, on Windows the NSIS packaging
tool is used to create executable installers from a project. CPack
runs the install rules of a project to create the install tree, which
is then given to a an installer program like NSIS.  CPack also
supports creating RPM, Debian <code>.deb</code> files, <code>.tar</code>,
<code>.tar.gz</code> and self-extracting tar files.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>5.2.3. Graphical Interfaces</h3>

<p>The first place many users first see CMake is one of CMake's user
interface programs. CMake has two main user interface programs:
a windowed Qt-based application, and a command line
curses graphics-based application. These GUIs are
graphical editors for the <code>CMakeCache.txt</code> file. They are
relatively simple interfaces with two buttons, configure and
generate, used to trigger the main phases of the CMake process. The
curses-based GUI is available on Unix TTY-type platforms and
Cygwin. The Qt GUI is available on all platforms.  The GUIs can be
seen in <a href="#fig.cma.gui1">Figure&nbsp;5.3</a> and <a href="#fig.cma.gui2">Figure&nbsp;5.4</a>.</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig.cma.gui1">
  <img src="../images/cmake/GUI1.png" alt="[Command Line Interface]" />
  <p>Figure&nbsp;5.3: Command Line Interface</p>
</div>

<div class="figure" id="fig.cma.gui2">
  <img src="../images/cmake/GUI2.png" alt="[Graphics-based Interface]" />
  <p>Figure&nbsp;5.4: Graphics-based Interface</p>
</div>

<p>Both GUIs have cache variable names on the left, and values on the
right. The values on the right can be changed by the user to values
that are appropriate for the build. There are two types of
variables, normal and advanced. By default the normal variables are
shown to the user. A project can determine which variables are
advanced inside the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> files for the project. This
allows users to be presented with as few choices as necessary for a
build.</p>

<p>Since cache values can be modified as the commands are executed, the
process of converging on a final build can be iterative. For example,
turning on an option may reveal additional options. For this reason,
the GUI disables the "generate" button until the user has had a
chance to see all options at least once. Each time the configure
button is pressed, new cache variables that have not yet been
presented to the user are displayed in red. Once there are
no new cache variables created during a configure run, the generate
button is enabled.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>5.2.4. Testing CMake</h3>

<p>Any new CMake developer is first introduced to the testing process
used in CMake development. The process makes use of the CMake family
of tools (CMake, CTest, CPack, and CDash).  As the code is developed
and checked into the version control system, continuous integration
testing machines automatically build and test the new CMake code using
CTest. The results are sent to a CDash server which notifies
developers via email if there are any build errors, compiler warnings,
or test failures.</p>

<p>The process is a classic continuous integration testing system. As new
code is checked into the CMake repository, it is automatically tested
on the platforms supported by CMake. Given the large number of
compilers and platforms that CMake supports, this type of testing
system is essential to the development of a stable build system.</p>

<p>For example, if a new developer wants to add support for a new
platform, the first question he or she is asked is whether they can
provide a nightly dashboard client for that system. Without constant
testing, it is inevitable that new systems will stop working after
some period of time.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>5.3. Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>CMake was successfully building ITK from day one, and that was the
most important part of the project. If we could redo the development
of CMake, not much would change. However, there are always things that
could have been done better.</p>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>5.3.1. Backwards Compatibility</h3>

<p>Maintaining backwards compatibility is important to the CMake
development team. The main goal of the project is to make building
software easier. When a project or developer chooses CMake for a build
tool, it is important to honor that choice and try very hard to not
break that build with future releases of CMake. CMake 2.6 implemented
a policy system where changes to CMake that would break existing
behavior will warn but still perform the old behavior. Each
<code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file is required to specify which version of
CMake they are expecting to use.  Newer versions of CMake might warn,
but will still build the project as older versions did.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>5.3.2. Language, Language, Language</h3>

<p>The CMake language is meant to be very simple. However, it is one of
the major obstacles to adoption when a new project is considering
CMake. Given its organic growth, the CMake language does have a few
quirks. The first parser for the language was not even lex/yacc based
but rather just a simple string parser. Given the chance to do the
language over, we would have spent some time looking for a nice
embedded language that already existed. Lua is the best fit that might
have worked. It is very small and clean. Even if an external language
like Lua was not used, I would have given more consideration to the
existing language from the start.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>5.3.3. Plugins Did Not Work</h3>

<p>To provide the ability for extension of the CMake language by
projects, CMake has a plugin class. This allows a project to create
new CMake commands in C. This sounded like a good idea at
the time, and the interface was defined for C so that different
compilers could be used. However, with the advent of multiple API
systems like 32/64 bit Windows and Linux, the compatibility of plugins
became hard to maintain. While extending CMake with the CMake language
is not as powerful, it avoids CMake crashing or not being able
to build a project because a plugin failed to build or load.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>5.3.4. Reduce Exposed APIs</h3>

<p>A big lesson learned during the development of the CMake project is
that you don't have to maintain backward compatibility with something
that users don't have access to. Several times during the development
of CMake, users and customers requested that CMake be made into a
library so that other languages could be bound to the CMake
functionality. Not only would this have fractured the CMake user
community with many different ways to use CMake, but it would have
been a huge maintenance cost for the CMake project.</p>
