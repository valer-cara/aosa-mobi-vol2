<h2>3.1. Introduction</h2>

<p>A Unix shell provides an interface that lets the user interact
with the operating system by running commands.
But a shell is also a fairly rich
programming language: there are constructs for flow control,
alternation, looping, conditionals, basic mathematical operations,
named functions, string variables, and two-way communication between
the shell and the commands it invokes.</p>

<p>Shells can be used interactively, from a terminal or terminal emulator
such as xterm, and non-interactively, reading commands from a file.
Most modern shells, including bash, provide command-line editing, in
which the command line can be manipulated using emacs- or vi-like
commands while it's being entered, and various forms of a saved
history of commands.</p>

<p>Bash processing is much like a shell pipeline: after being read from
the terminal or a script, data is passed through a number of stages,
transformed at each step, until the shell finally executes a command
and collects its return status.</p>

<p>This chapter will explore bash's major components: input processing,
parsing, the various word expansions and other command processing, and
command execution, from the pipeline perspective.  These components
act as a pipeline for data read from the keyboard or from a file,
turning it into an executed command.</p>

<h3>3.1.1. Bash</h3>

<p>Bash is the shell that appears in the GNU operating system, commonly
implemented atop the Linux kernel, and several other common operating
systems, most notably Mac OS X.  It offers functional improvements
over historical versions of sh for both interactive and programming
use.</p>

<p>The name is an acronym for Bourne-Again SHell, a pun combining the
name of Stephen Bourne (the author of the direct ancestor of the
current Unix shell <code>/bin/sh</code>, which appeared in the Bell Labs
Seventh Edition Research version of Unix) with the notion of rebirth
through reimplementation.
The original author of bash was Brian Fox, an employee of the Free
Software Foundation.  I am the current developer and maintainer, a
volunteer who works at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland,
Ohio.</p>

<p>Like other GNU software, bash is quite portable.  It currently runs on
nearly every version of Unix and a few other operating
systems&mdash;independently-supported ports exist for hosted Windows
environments such as Cygwin and MinGW, and ports to Unix-like systems
such as QNX and Minix are part of the distribution.  It only requires
a Posix environment to build and run, such as one provided by
Microsoft's Services for Unix (SFU).</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>3.2. Syntactic Units and Primitives</h2>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.2.1. Primitives</h3>

<p>To bash, there are basically three kinds of tokens: reserved
words, words, and operators.  Reserved words are those that have
meaning to the shell and its programming language; usually these words
introduce flow control constructs, like <code>if</code> and <code>while</code>.
Operators are composed of one or more metacharacters: characters that
have special meaning to the shell on their own, such as <code>|</code> and
<code>&gt;</code>.  The rest of the shell's input consists of
ordinary words, some of which have special meaning&mdash;assignment
statements or numbers, for instance&mdash;depending on where they appear
on the command line.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.2.2. Variables and Parameters</h3>

<p>As in any programming language, shells provide variables: names to
refer to stored data and operate on it.  The shell provides basic
user-settable variables and some built-in variables referred to as
parameters.  Shell parameters generally reflect some aspect of the
shell's internal state, and are set automatically or as a side effect
of another operation.</p>

<p>Variable values are strings.  Some values are treated specially
depending on context; these will be explained later.  Variables are
assigned using statements of the form <code>name=value</code>.  The
<code>value</code> is optional; omitting it assigns the empty string to
<code>name</code>.  If the value is supplied, the shell expands the value
and assigns it to <code>name</code>.  The shell can perform different
operations based on whether or not a variable is set, but assigning a
value is the only way to set a variable.  Variables that have not been
assigned a value, even if they have been declared and given
attributes, are referred to as <em>unset</em>.</p>

<p>A word beginning with a dollar sign introduces a variable or parameter
reference.  The word, including the dollar sign, is replaced with the
value of the named variable.  The shell provides a rich set of
expansion operators, from simple value replacement to changing or
removing portions of a variable's value that match a pattern.</p>

<p>There are provisions for local and global variables.  By default, all
variables are global.  Any simple command (the most familiar type of
command&mdash;a command name and optional set of arguments and
redirections) may be prefixed by a set of assignment statements to
cause those variables to exist only for that command.  The shell
implements stored procedures, or shell functions, which can have
function-local variables.</p>

<p>Variables can be minimally typed: in addition to simple string-valued
variables, there are integers and arrays.  Integer-typed variables are
treated as numbers: any string assigned to them is expanded as an
arithmetic expression and the result is assigned as the variable's
value.  Arrays may be indexed or associative; indexed arrays use
numbers as subscripts, while associative arrays use arbitrary strings.
Array elements are strings, which can be treated as integers if
desired.  Array elements may not be other arrays.</p>

<p>Bash uses hash tables to store and retrieve shell variables, and
linked lists of these hash tables to implement variable scoping.
There are different variable scopes for shell function calls and
temporary scopes for variables set by assignment statements preceding
a command.  When those assignment statements precede a command that is
built into the shell, for instance, the shell has to keep track of the
correct order in which to resolve variable references, and the linked
scopes allow bash to do that.  There can be a surprising number of
scopes to traverse depending on the execution nesting level.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.2.3. The Shell Programming Language</h3>

<p>A <em>simple</em> shell command, one with which most readers are most
familiar, consists of a command name, such as <code>echo</code> or
<code>cd</code>, and a list of zero or more arguments and redirections.
Redirections allow the shell user to control the input to and output
from invoked commands.  As noted above, users can define variables
local to simple commands.</p>

<p>Reserved words introduce more complex shell commands.  There are
constructs common to any high-level programming language, such as
<code>if-then-else</code>, <code>while</code>, a <code>for</code> loop that iterates
over a list of values, and a C-like arithmetic <code>for</code> loop.
These more complex commands allow the shell to execute a
command or otherwise test a condition and perform different operations
based on the result, or execute commands multiple times.</p>

<p>One of the gifts Unix brought the computing world is the pipeline: a
linear list of commands, in which the output of one command in the
list becomes the input of the next.  Any shell construct can be used
in a pipeline, and it's not uncommon to see pipelines in which a
command feeds data to a loop.</p>

<p>Bash implements a facility that allows the standard input, standard
output, and standard error streams for a command to be redirected to
another file or process when the command is invoked.  Shell
programmers can also use redirection to open and close files in the
current shell environment.</p>

<p>Bash allows shell programs to be stored and used more than once.
Shell functions and shell scripts are both ways to name a group of
commands and execute the group, just like executing any other command.
Shell functions are declared using a special syntax and stored and
executed in the same shell's context; shell scripts are created by
putting commands into a file and executing a new instance of the shell
to interpret them.  Shell functions share most of the execution
context with the shell that calls them, but shell scripts, since they
are interpreted by a new shell invocation, share only what is passed
between processes in the environment.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.2.4. A Further Note</h3>

<p>As you read further, keep in mind that the shell implements its
features using only a few data structures: arrays, trees,
singly-linked and doubly-linked lists, and hash tables.  Nearly all of
the shell constructs are implemented using these primitives.</p>

<p>The basic data structure the shell uses to pass information from one
stage to the next, and to operate on data units within each processing
stage, is the <code>WORD_DESC</code>:</p>

<pre>
typedef struct word_desc {
  char *word;           /* Zero terminated string. */
  int flags;            /* Flags associated with this word. */
} WORD_DESC;
</pre>

<p class="continue">Words are combined into, for example, argument lists, using simple
linked lists:</p>

<pre>
typedef struct word_list {
  struct word_list *next;
  WORD_DESC *word;
} WORD_LIST;
</pre>

<p><code>WORD_LIST</code>s are pervasive throughout the shell.  A simple
command is a word list, the result of expansion is a word list, and
the built-in commands each take a word list of arguments.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>3.3. Input Processing</h2>

<p>The first stage of the bash processing pipeline is input processing:
taking characters from the terminal or a file, breaking them into
lines, and passing the lines to the shell parser to transform into
commands.  As you would expect, the lines are
sequences of characters terminated by newlines.</p>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.3.1. Readline and Command Line Editing</h3>

<p>Bash reads input from the terminal when interactive, and from the
script file specified as an argument otherwise.  When interactive,
bash allows the user to edit command lines as they are typed in, using
familiar key sequences and editing commands similar to the Unix emacs
and vi editors.</p>

<p>Bash uses the readline library to implement command line editing.
This provides a set of functions allowing users to edit command lines,
functions to save command lines as they are entered, to recall
previous commands, and to perform csh-like history expansion.  Bash is
readline's primary client, and they are developed together, but there
is no bash-specific code in readline.  Many other projects have
adopted readline to provide a terminal-based line editing interface.</p>

<p>Readline also allows users to bind key sequences of unlimited length
to any of a large number of readline commands.  Readline has commands
to move the cursor around the line, insert and remove text, retrieve
previous lines, and complete partially-typed words.  On top of this,
users may define macros, which are strings of characters that are
inserted into the line in response to a key sequence, using the same
syntax as key bindings.  Macros afford readline users a simple string
substitution and shorthand facility.</p>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Readline Structure</h4>

<p>Readline is structured as a basic read/dispatch/execute/redisplay
loop.  It reads characters from the keyboard using <code>read</code> or
equivalent, or obtains input from a macro.  Each character is used as
an index into a keymap, or dispatch table.  Though indexed by a single
eight-bit character, the contents of each element of the keymap can be
several things.  The characters can resolve to additional keymaps,
which is how multiple-character key sequences are possible.  Resolving
to a readline command, such as <code>beginning-of-line</code>, causes that
command to be executed.
A character bound to the <code>self-insert</code> command is stored into the
editing buffer.
It's also possible to bind a key sequence to
a command while simultaneously binding subsequences to different
commands (a relatively recently-added feature); there is a special
index into a keymap to indicate that this is done.  Binding a key
sequence to a macro provides a great deal of flexibility, from
inserting arbitrary strings into a command line to creating
keyboard shortcuts for complex editing sequences.  Readline stores
each character bound to <code>self-insert</code> in the
editing buffer, which when displayed may occupy one or more lines on
the screen.</p>

<p>Readline manages only character buffers and strings using C
<code>char</code>s, and builds multibyte characters out of them if
necessary.  It does not use <code>wchar_t</code> internally for both speed
and storage reasons, and because the editing code existed before
multibyte character support became widespread.  When in a locale that
supports multibyte characters, readline automatically reads an entire
multibyte character and inserts it into the editing buffer.  It's
possible to bind multibyte characters to editing commands, but one has
to bind such a character as a key sequence; this is possible, but
difficult and usually not wanted.  The existing emacs and vi command
sets do not use multibyte characters, for instance.</p>

<p>Once a key sequence finally resolves to an editing command,
readline updates the terminal display to reflect the
results.
This happens regardless of whether the command
results in characters being inserted into the buffer, the editing
position being moved, or the line being partially or completely
replaced.
Some bindable editing commands, such as those that modify
the history file, do not cause any change to the contents of the
editing buffer.</p>

<p>Updating the terminal display, while seemingly simple, is quite
involved.  Readline has to keep track of three things: the current
contents of the buffer of characters displayed on the screen, the
updated contents of that display buffer, and the actual characters
displayed.  In the presence of multibyte characters, the characters
displayed do not exactly match the buffer, and the redisplay engine
must take that into account.  When redisplaying, readline must compare
the current display buffer's contents with the updated buffer, figure
out the differences, and decide how to most efficiently modify the
display to reflect the updated buffer.  This problem has been the
subject of considerable research through the years (the
<em>string-to-string correction problem</em>).  Readline's approach is to
identify the beginning and end of the portion of the buffer that
differs, compute the cost of updating just that portion, including
moving the cursor backward and forward (e.g., will it take more effort
to issue terminal commands to delete characters and then insert new
ones than to simply overwrite the current screen contents?), perform
the lowest-cost update, then clean up by removing any characters
remaining at the end of the line if necessary and position the cursor
in the correct spot.</p>

<p>The redisplay engine is without question the one piece of readline
that has been modified most heavily.  Most of the changes have been to
add functionality&mdash;most significantly, the ability to have
non-displaying characters in the prompt (to change colors, for instance)
and to cope with characters
that take up more than a single byte.</p>

<p>Readline returns the contents of the editing buffer to the calling
application, which is then responsible for saving the
possibly-modified results in the history list.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsubsect">
<h4>Applications Extending Readline</h4>

<p>Just as readline offers users a variety of ways to customize and
extend readline's default behavior, it provides a number of mechanisms
for applications to extend its default feature set.  First, bindable
readline functions accept a standard set of arguments and return a
specified set of results, making it easy for applications to extend
readline with application-specific functions.  Bash, for instance,
adds more than thirty bindable commands, from bash-specific word
completions to interfaces to shell built-in commands.</p>

<p>The second way readline allows applications to modify its behavior is
through the pervasive use of pointers to hook functions with
well-known names and calling interfaces.  Applications can replace
some portions of readline's internals, interpose functionality in
front of readline, and perform application-specific
transformations.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.3.2. Non-interactive Input Processing</h3>

<p>When the shell is not using readline, it uses either <code>stdio</code> or its own
buffered input routines to obtain input.  The bash buffered input
package is preferable to <code>stdio</code> when the shell is not interactive
because of the somewhat peculiar restrictions Posix imposes on input
consumption: the shell must consume only the input necessary to parse
a command and leave the rest for executed programs.  This is
particularly important when the shell is reading a script from the
standard input.  The shell is allowed to buffer input as much as it
wants, as long as it is able to roll the file offset back to just
after the last character the parser consumes.  As a practical matter,
this means that the shell must read scripts a character at a time when
reading from non-seekable devices such as pipes, but may buffer as
many characters as it likes when reading from files.</p>

<p>These idiosyncrasies aside, the output of the non-interactive input
portion of shell processing is the same as readline: a buffer of
characters terminated by a newline.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.3.3. Multibyte Characters</h3>

<p>Multibyte character processing was added to the shell a long time
after its initial implementation, and it was done in a way designed to
minimize its impact on the existing code.  When in a locale that
supports multibyte characters, the shell stores its input in a buffer
of bytes (C <code>char</code>s), but treats these bytes as potentially
multibyte characters.  Readline understands how to display multibyte
characters (the key is knowing how many screen positions a multibyte
character occupies, and how many bytes to consume from a buffer when
displaying a character on the screen), how to move forward and
backward in the line a character at a time, as opposed to a byte at a
time, and so on.  Other than that, multibyte characters don't have
much effect on shell input processing.  Other parts of the shell,
described later, need to be aware of multibyte characters and take
them into account when processing their input.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>3.4. Parsing</h2>

<p>The initial job of the parsing engine is lexical analysis: to separate
the stream of characters into words and apply meaning to the result.
The word is the basic unit on which the parser operates.  Words are
sequences of characters separated by metacharacters, which include
simple separators like spaces and tabs, or characters that are special
to the shell language, like semicolons and ampersands.</p>

<p>One historical problem with the shell, as Tom Duff said in his paper
about <code>rc</code>, the Plan 9 shell, is that nobody really knows what
the Bourne shell grammar is.  The Posix shell committee deserves
significant credit for finally publishing a definitive grammar for a
Unix shell, albeit one that has plenty of context dependencies.  That
grammar isn't without its problems&mdash;it disallows some constructs that
historical Bourne shell parsers have accepted without error&mdash;but it's
the best we have.</p>

<p>The bash parser is derived from an early version of the Posix grammar,
and is, as far as I know, the only Bourne-style shell parser
implemented using Yacc or Bison.  This has presented its own set of
difficulties&mdash;the shell grammar isn't really well-suited to
yacc-style parsing and requires some complicated lexical analysis and
a lot of cooperation between the parser and the lexical analyzer.</p>

<p>In any event, the lexical analyzer takes lines of input from readline
or another source, breaks them into tokens at metacharacters,
identifies the tokens based on context, and passes them on to the
parser to be assembled into statements and commands.  There is a lot
of context involved&mdash;for instance, the word <code>for</code> can be a
reserved word, an identifier, part of an assignment statement, or
other word, and the following is a perfectly valid command:</p>

<pre>
for for in for; do for=for; done; echo $for
</pre>

<p class="continue">that displays <code>for</code>.</p>

<p>At this point, a short digression about aliasing is in order.  Bash
allows the first word of a simple command to be replaced with
arbitrary text using aliases.  Since they're completely lexical,
aliases can even be used (or abused) to change the shell grammar: it's
possible to write an alias that implements a compound command that
bash doesn't provide.  The bash parser implements aliasing completely
in the lexical phase, though the parser has to inform the analyzer
when alias expansion is permitted.</p>

<p>Like many programming languages, the shell allows characters to be
escaped to remove their special meaning, so that metacharacters such as
<code>&amp;</code> can appear in commands.  There are three types of quoting,
each of which is slightly different and permits slightly different
interpretations of the quoted text: the backslash, which escapes the
next character; single quotes, which prevent interpretation of all
enclosed characters; and double quotes, which prevent some
interpretation but allow certain word expansions (and treats
backslashes differently).  The lexical analyzer interprets quoted
characters and strings and prevents them from being recognized by the
parser as reserved words or metacharacters.  There are also two
special cases, <code>$'&hellip;'</code> and <code>$"&hellip;"</code>, that expand
backslash-escaped characters in the same fashion as ANSI C strings and
allow characters to be translated using standard internationalization
functions, respectively.  The former is widely used; the latter,
perhaps because there are few good examples or use cases, less so.</p>

<p>The rest of the interface between the parser and lexical analyzer is
straightforward.  The parser encodes a certain amount of state and
shares it with the analyzer to allow the sort of context-dependent
analysis the grammar requires.  For example, the lexical analyzer
categorizes words according to the token type: reserved word (in the
appropriate context), word, assignment statement, and so on.  In order
to do this, the parser has to tell it something about how far it has
progressed parsing a command, whether it is processing a
multiline string (sometimes called a "here-document"),
whether it's in a case statement or a conditional
command, or whether it is processing an extended shell pattern or compound
assignment statement.</p>

<p>Much of the work to recognize the end of the command substitution
during the parsing stage is encapsulated into a single function
(<code>parse_comsub</code>), which knows an uncomfortable amount of shell
syntax and duplicates rather more of the token-reading code than is
optimal.  This function has to know about here documents, shell
comments, metacharacters and word boundaries, quoting, and when
reserved words are acceptable (so it knows when it's in a <code>case</code>
statement); it took a while to get that right.</p>

<p>When expanding a
command substitution during word expansion, bash uses the parser to
find the correct end of the construct.  This is similar to turning a
string into a command for <code>eval</code>, but in this
case the command isn't terminated by the end of the string.  In order
to make this work, the parser must recognize a right parenthesis as a
valid command terminator, which leads to special cases in a number of
grammar productions and requires the lexical analyzer to flag a right
parenthesis (in the appropriate context) as denoting EOF.  The parser
also has to save and restore parser state before recursively invoking
<code>yyparse</code>, since a command substitution can be parsed and
executed as part of expanding a prompt string in the middle of reading
a command.  Since the input functions implement read-ahead, this
function must finally take care of rewinding the bash input pointer to
the right spot, whether bash is reading input from a string, a file,
or the terminal using readline.  This is important not only so that
input is not lost, but so the command substitution expansion functions
construct the correct string for execution.</p>

<p>Similar problems are posed by programmable word completion, which allows
arbitrary commands to be executed while parsing another command,
and solved by saving and restoring parser state around invocations.</p>

<p>Quoting is also a source of incompatibility and debate.  Twenty years
after the publication of the first Posix shell standard, members of
the standards working group are still debating the proper behavior of
obscure quoting.  As before, the Bourne shell is no help other than as
a reference implementation to observe behavior.</p>

<p>The parser returns a single C structure representing a command (which,
in the case of compound commands like loops, may include other
commands in turn) and passes it to the next stage of the shell's
operation: word expansion.  The command structure is composed of
command objects and lists of words.  Most of the word lists are
subject to various transformations, depending on their context, as
explained in the following sections.</p>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>3.5. Word Expansions</h2>

<p>After parsing, but before execution, many of the words produced by the
parsing stage are subjected to one or more word expansions, so that
(for example) <code>$OSTYPE</code> is replaced with the string
<code>"linux-gnu"</code>.</p>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.5.1. Parameter and Variable Expansions</h3>

<p>Variable expansions are the ones users find most familiar.  Shell
variables are barely typed, and, with few exceptions, are treated as
strings.  The expansions expand and transform these strings into new
words and word lists.</p>

<p>There are expansions that act on the variable's value itself.
Programmers can use these to produce substrings of a variable's
value, the value's length, remove portions that match a specified
pattern from the beginning or end, replace portions of the value
matching a specified pattern with a new string, or modify the case of
alphabetic characters in a variable's value.</p>

<p>In addition, there are expansions that depend on the state of a
variable: different expansions or assignments happen based on whether
or not the variable is set.  For instance,
<code>${parameter:-word}</code> will expand to <code>parameter</code> if it's
set, and <code>word</code> if it's not set or set to the empty string.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.5.2. And Many More</h3>

<p>Bash does many other kinds of expansion, each of which has its own
quirky rules.  The first in processing order is brace expansion, which
turns:</p>

<pre>
pre{one,two,three}post
</pre>

<p class="continue">into:</p>

<pre>
preonepost pretwopost prethreepost
</pre>

<p>There is also command substitution, which is a nice marriage of the
shell's ability to run commands and manipulate variables.  The shell
runs a command, collects the output, and uses that output as the value
of the expansion.</p>

<p>One of the problems with command substitution is that it runs the
enclosed command immediately and waits for it to complete: there's
no easy way for the shell to send input to it.  Bash uses a feature
named process substitution, a sort of combination of command
substitution and shell pipelines, to compensate for these
shortcomings.  Like command substitution, bash runs a command, but
lets it run in the background and doesn't wait for it to complete.
The key is that bash opens a pipe to the command for reading or
writing and exposes it as a filename, which becomes the result of the
expansion.</p>

<p>Next is tilde expansion.  Originally intended to turn
<code>~alan</code> into a
reference to Alan's home directory, it has grown over the years into a
way to refer to a large number of different directories.</p>

<p>Finally, there is arithmetic expansion.  <code>$((expression))</code>
causes <code>expression</code> to be evaluated according to the same rules
as C language expressions.  The result of the expression becomes the
result of the expansion.</p>

<p>Variable expansion is where the difference between single and double
quotes becomes most apparent.  Single quotes inhibit all
expansions&mdash;the characters enclosed by the quotes pass through the
expansions unscathed&mdash;whereas double quotes permit some expansions
and inhibit others.  The word expansions and command, arithmetic, and
process substitution take place&mdash;the double quotes only affect how
the result is handled&mdash;but brace and tilde expansion do not.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.5.3. Word Splitting</h3>

<p>The results of the word expansions are split using the characters in
the value of the shell variable <code>IFS</code> as delimiters.  This is how
the shell transforms a single word into more than one.  Each time one
of the characters in <code>$IFS</code><sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> appears in the result, bash splits the word into
two.  Single and double quotes both inhibit word splitting.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.5.4. Globbing</h3>

<p>After the results are split, the shell interprets each word resulting
from the previous expansions as a potential pattern and tries to match
it against an existing filename, including any leading directory path.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.5.5. Implementation</h3>

<p>If the basic architecture of the shell parallels a pipeline, the word
expansions are a small pipeline unto themselves.  Each stage of word
expansion takes a word and, after possibly transforming it, passes it
to the next expansion stage.  After all the word expansions have been
performed, the command is executed.</p>

<p>The bash implementation of word expansions builds on the basic data
structures already described.  The words output by the parser are
expanded individually, resulting in one or more words for each input
word.  The <code>WORD_DESC</code> data structure has proved versatile
enough to hold all the information required to encapsulate the
expansion of a single word. The flags are used to encode information
for use within the word expansion stage and to pass information from
one stage to the next. For instance, the parser uses a flag to tell
the expansion and command execution stages that a particular word is a
shell assignment statement, and the word expansion code uses flags
internally to inhibit word splitting or note the presence of a quoted
null string (<code>"$x"</code>, where <code>$x</code> is unset or has a null
value).  Using a single character string for each word being expanded,
with some kind of character encoding to represent additional
information, would have proved much more difficult.</p>

<p>As with the parser, the word expansion code handles characters whose
representation requires more than a single byte.  For example, the
variable length expansion (<code>${#variable}</code>) counts the length in
characters, rather than bytes, and the code can correctly identify the
end of expansions or characters special to expansions in the presence
of multibyte characters.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>3.6. Command Execution</h2>

<p>The command execution stage of the internal bash pipeline is where the
real action happens.  Most of the time, the set of expanded words is
decomposed into a command name and set of arguments, and passed to the
operating system as a file to be read and executed with the remaining
words passed as the rest of the elements of <code>argv</code>.</p>

<p>The description thus far has deliberately concentrated on what Posix
calls simple commands&mdash;those with a command name and a set of
arguments.  This is the most common type of command, but bash provides
much more.</p>

<p>The input to the command execution stage is the command structure
built by the parser and a set of possibly-expanded words.  This is
where the real bash programming language comes into play.  The
programming language uses the variables and expansions discussed
previously, and implements the constructs one would expect in a
high-level language: looping, conditionals, alternation, grouping,
selection, conditional execution based on pattern matching, expression
evaluation, and several higher-level constructs specific to the shell.</p>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.6.1. Redirection</h3>

<p>One reflection of the shell's role as an interface to the operating
system is the ability to redirect input and output to and from the
commands it invokes.  The redirection syntax is one of the things that
reveals the sophistication of the shell's early users: until very
recently, it required users to keep track of the file descriptors they
were using, and explicitly specify by number any other than standard
input, output, and error.</p>

<p>A recent addition to the redirection syntax allows users to direct the
shell to choose a suitable file descriptor and assign it to a
specified variable, instead of having the user choose one.  This
reduces the programmer's burden of keeping track of file descriptors,
but adds extra processing: the shell has to duplicate file descriptors
in the right place, and make sure they are assigned to the specified
variable.  This is another example of how information is passed from
the lexical analyzer to the parser through to command execution: the
analyzer classifies the word as a redirection containing a variable
assignment; the parser, in the appropriate grammar production, creates
the redirection object with a flag indicating assignment is required;
and the redirection code interprets the flag and ensures that the file
descriptor number is assigned to the correct variable.</p>

<p>The hardest part of implementing redirection is remembering how to
undo redirections.  The shell deliberately blurs the distinction
between commands executed from the filesystem that cause the creation
of a new process and commands the shell executes itself (builtins),
but, no matter how the command is implemented, the effects of
redirections should not persist beyond the command's completion<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>. The shell therefore has
to keep track of how to undo the effects of each redirection,
otherwise redirecting the output of a shell builtin would change the
shell's standard output.  Bash knows how to undo each type of
redirection, either by closing a file descriptor that it allocated, or
by saving file descriptor being duplicated to and restoring it later
using <code>dup2</code>.  These use the same redirection objects as those
created by the parser and are processed using the same functions.</p>

<p>Since multiple redirections are implemented as simple lists of
objects, the redirections used to undo are kept in a separate list.
That list is processed when a command completes, but the shell has to
take care when it does so, since redirections attached to a shell
function or the "<code>.</code>" builtin must stay in effect until that
function or builtin completes.  When it doesn't invoke a command, the
<code>exec</code> builtin causes the undo list to simply be discarded,
because redirections associated with <code>exec</code> persist in the shell
environment.</p>

<p>The other complication is one bash brought on itself.  Historical
versions of the Bourne shell allowed the user to manipulate only file
descriptors 0-9, reserving descriptors 10 and above for the shell's
internal use.  Bash relaxed this restriction, allowing a user to
manipulate any descriptor up to the process's open file limit.  This
means that bash has to keep track of its own internal file
descriptors, including those opened by external libraries and not
directly by the shell, and be prepared to move them around on demand.
This requires a lot of bookkeeping, some heuristics involving the
close-on-exec flag, and yet another list of redirections to be
maintained for the duration of a command and then either processed or
discarded.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.6.2. Builtin Commands</h3>

<p>Bash makes a number of commands part of the shell itself.  These
commands are executed by the shell, without creating a new process.</p>

<p>The most common reason to make a command a builtin is to maintain or
modify the shell's internal state.  <code>cd</code> is a good example; one
of the classic exercises for introduction to Unix classes is to
explain why <code>cd</code> can't be implemented as an external command.</p>

<p>Bash builtins use the same internal primitives as the rest of the
shell.  Each builtin is implemented using a C language function that
takes a list of words as arguments.  The words are those output by the
word expansion stage; the builtins treat them as command names and
arguments.  For the most part, the builtins use the same standard
expansion rules as any other command, with a couple of exceptions: the
bash builtins that accept assignment statements as arguments (e.g.,
<code>declare</code> and <code>export</code>) use the same expansion rules for the
assignment arguments as those the shell uses for variable assignments.
This is one place where the <code>flags</code> member of the
<code>WORD_DESC</code> structure is used to pass information between one
stage of the shell's internal pipeline and another.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.6.3. Simple Command Execution</h3>

<p>Simple commands are the ones most commonly encountered.  The search
for and execution of commands read from the filesystem, and
collection of their exit status, covers many of the shell's remaining
features.</p>

<p>Shell variable assignments (i.e., words of the form <code>var=value</code>) are a
kind of simple command themselves.  Assignment statements can either
precede a command name or stand alone on a command line.  If they
precede a command, the variables are passed to the executed command in
its environment (if they precede a built-in command or shell function,
they persist, with a few exceptions, only as long as the builtin or
function executes).  If they're not followed by a command name, the
assignment statements modify the shell's state.</p>

<p>When presented a command name that is not the name of a shell function
or builtin, bash searches the filesystem for an executable file with
that name.  The value of the <code>PATH</code> variable is used as a
colon-separated list of directories in which to search.  Command names
containing slashes (or other directory separators) are not looked up,
but are executed directly.</p>

<p>When a command is found using a <code>PATH</code> search, bash saves the
command name and the corresponding full pathname in a hash table,
which it consults before conducting subsequent <code>PATH</code> searches.
If the command is not found, bash executes a specially-named function,
if it's defined, with the command name and arguments as arguments to
the function.  Some Linux distributions use this facility to offer to
install missing commands.</p>

<p>If bash finds a file to execute, it forks and creates a new execution
environment, and executes the program in this new environment.  The
execution environment is an exact duplicate of the shell environment,
with minor modifications to things like signal disposition and files
opened and closed by redirections.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.6.4. Job Control</h3>

<p>The shell can execute commands in the foreground, in which it waits
for the command to finish and collects its exit status, or the
background, where the shell immediately reads the next command.  Job
control is the ability to move processes (commands being executed)
between the foreground and background, and to suspend and resume their
execution.  To implement this, bash introduces the concept of a job,
which is essentially a command being executed by one or more
processes. A pipeline, for instance, uses one process for each of its elements.
The process group is a way to join separate processes
together into a single job.  The terminal has a process group ID
associated with it, so the foreground process group is the one whose
process group ID is the same as the terminal's.</p>

<p>The shell uses a few simple data structures in its job control
implementation.  There is a structure to represent a child process,
including its process ID, its state, and the status it returned when
it terminated.  A pipeline is just a simple linked list of these
process structures.  A job is quite similar: there is a list of
processes, some job state (running, suspended, exited, etc.), and the
job's process group ID.  The process list usually consists of a single
process; only pipelines result in more than one process being
associated with a job.  Each job has a unique process group ID, and
the process in the job whose process ID is the same as the job's
process group ID is called the process group leader.  The current set
of jobs is kept in an array, conceptually very similar to how it's
presented to the user.  The job's state and exit status are assembled
by aggregating the state and exit statuses of the constituent
processes.</p>

<p>Like several other things in the shell, the complex part about
implementing job control is bookkeeping.  The shell must take care to
assign processes to the correct process groups, make sure that child
process creation and process group assignment are synchronized, and
that the terminal's process group is set appropriately, since the
terminal's process group determines the foreground job (and, if it's
not set back to the shell's process group, the shell itself won't be
able to read terminal input).  Since it's so process-oriented, it's
not straightforward to implement compound commands such as
<code>while</code> and <code>for</code> loops so an entire loop can be stopped and
started as a unit, and few shells have done so.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.6.5. Compound Commands</h3>

<p>Compound commands consist of lists of one or more simple commands and
are introduced by a keyword such as <code>if</code> or <code>while</code>.  This
is where the programming power of the shell is most visible and
effective.</p>

<p>The implementation is fairly unsurprising.  The parser constructs
objects corresponding to the various compound commands, and interprets
them by traversing the object.  Each compound command is implemented
by a corresponding C function that is responsible for performing the
appropriate expansions, executing commands as specified, and altering
the execution flow based on the command's return status.  The function
that implements the <code>for</code> command is illustrative.  It must first
expand the list of words following the <code>in</code> reserved word.  The
function must then iterate through the expanded words, assigning each
word to the appropriate variable, then executing the list of commands
in the <code>for</code> command's body.  The for command doesn't have to
alter execution based on the return status of the command, but it does
have to pay attention to the effects of the <code>break</code> and
<code>continue</code> builtins.  Once all the words in the list have been
used, the <code>for</code> command returns.  As this shows, for the most
part, the implementation follows the description very closely.</p>

<h2>3.7. Lessons Learned</h2>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.7.1. What I Have Found Is Important</h3>

<p>I have spent over twenty years working on bash, and I'd like to think
I have discovered a few things.
The most important&mdash;one that I can't stress enough&mdash;is that it's
vital to have detailed change logs.  It's good when you can go back to
your change logs and remind yourself about why a particular change was
made. It's even better when you can tie that change to a particular
bug report, complete with a reproducible test case, or a suggestion.</p>

<p>If it's appropriate, extensive regression testing is something I would
recommend building into a project from the beginning.  Bash has
thousands of test cases covering virtually all of its non-interactive
features. I have considered building tests for interactive
features&mdash;Posix has them in its conformance test suite&mdash;but did not
want to have to distribute the framework I judged it would need.</p>

<p>Standards are important.  Bash has benefited from being an
implementation of a standard.  It's important to participate in the
standardization of the software you're implementing.  In addition to
discussions about features and their behavior, having a standard to
refer to as the arbiter can work well.  Of course, it can also work poorly&mdash;it
depends on the standard.</p>

<p>External standards are important, but it's good to have
internal standards as well.  I was lucky enough to fall into the GNU
Project's set of standards, which provide plenty of good, practical
advice about design and implementation.</p>

<p>Good documentation is another essential.  If you expect a program to
be used by others, it's worth having comprehensive, clear
documentation.  If software is successful, there will end up being
lots of documentation for it, and it's important that the developer
writes the authoritative version.</p>

<p>There's a lot of good software out there.  Use what you can: for
instance, gnulib has a lot of convenient library functions (once you
can unravel them from the gnulib framework).  So do the BSDs and Mac
OS X.  Picasso said "Great artists steal" for a reason.</p>

<p>Engage the user community, but be prepared for occasional criticism,
some that will be head-scratching.  An active user community can be a
tremendous benefit, but one consequence is that people will become
very passionate.  Don't take it personally.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>3.7.2. What I Would Have Done Differently</h3>

<p>Bash has millions of users.  I've been educated about the importance
of backwards compatibility.  In some sense, backwards compatibility
means never having to say you're sorry.  The world, however, isn't
quite that simple.  I've had to make incompatible changes from time to
time, nearly all of which generated some number of user complaints,
though I always had what I considered to be a valid reason, whether
that was to correct a bad decision, to fix a design misfeature, or to
correct incompatibilities between parts of the shell.  I would have
introduced something like formal bash compatibility levels
earlier.</p>

<p>Bash's development has never been particularly open.  I have become
comfortable with the idea of milestone releases (e.g., bash-4.2) and
individually-released patches.  There are reasons for doing this: I
accommodate vendors with longer release timelines than the free
software and open source worlds, and I've had trouble in the past with
beta software becoming more widespread than I'd like.  If I had to
start over again, though, I would have considered more frequent
releases, using some kind of public repository.</p>

<p>No such list would be complete without an implementation
consideration.  One thing I've considered multiple times, but never
done, is rewriting the bash parser using straight recursive-descent
rather than using <code>bison</code>.  I once thought I'd have to do this in
order to make command substitution conform to Posix, but I was able to
resolve that issue without changes that extensive.  Were I starting
bash from scratch, I probably would have written a parser by hand.  It
certainly would have made some things easier.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>3.8. Conclusions</h2>

<p>Bash is a good example of a large, complex piece of free software.  It
has had the benefit of more than twenty years of development, and is
mature and powerful.  It runs nearly everywhere, and is used by
millions of people every day, many of whom don't realize it.</p>

<p>Bash has been influenced by many sources, dating back to the original
7th Edition Unix shell, written by Stephen Bourne.  The most
significant influence is the Posix standard, which dictates a
significant portion of its behavior.  This combination of backwards
compatibility and standards compliance has brought its own challenges.</p>

<p>Bash has profited by being part of the GNU Project, which has provided
a movement and a framework in which bash exists.  Without GNU, there
would be no bash.  Bash has also benefited from its active, vibrant
user community.  Their feedback has helped to make bash what it is
today&mdash;a testament to the benefits of free software.</p>
