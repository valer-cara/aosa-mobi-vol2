<p>Continuous Integration (CI) systems are systems that build and test
software automatically and regularly.  Though their primary benefit
lies in avoiding long periods between build and test runs, CI systems
can also simplify and automate the execution of many otherwise tedious
tasks. These include cross-platform testing, the regular running of slow,
data-intensive, or difficult-to-configure tests, verification of
proper performance on legacy platforms, detection of infrequently
failing tests, and the regular production of up-to-date release
products. And, because build and test automation is necessary for
implementing continuous integration, CI is often a first step towards
a <em>continuous deployment</em> framework wherein software updates can be
deployed quickly to live systems after testing.</p>

<p>Continuous integration is a timely subject, not least because of its
prominence in the Agile software methodology.  There has been an
explosion of open source CI tools in recent years, in and for a
variety of languages, implementing a huge range of features in the
context of a diverse set of architectural models.  The purpose of this
chapter is to describe common sets of features implemented in
continuous integration systems, discuss the architectural options
available, and examine which features may or may not be easy to
implement given the choice of architecture.</p>

<p>Below, we will briefly describe a set of systems that exemplify the
extremes of architectural choices available when designing a CI
system. The first, Buildbot, is a master/slave system; the second,
CDash is a reporting server model; the third Jenkins, uses a hybrid model; and the fourth, Pony-Build,
is a Python-based decentralized reporting server that we will use
as a foil for further discussion.</p>

<div class="sect">
<h2>9.1. The Landscape</h2>

<p>The space of architectures for continuous integration systems seems to
be dominated by two extremes: master/slave architectures, in which a
central server directs and controls remote builds; and reporting
architectures, in which a central server aggregates build reports
contributed by clients. All of the continuous integration systems of
which we are aware have chosen some combination of features from these
two architectures.</p>

<p>Our example of a centralized architecture, Buildbot, is composed of
two parts: the central server, or <em>buildmaster</em>, which schedules and
coordinates builds between one or more connected clients; and the
clients, or <em>buildslaves</em>, which execute builds. The buildmaster
provides a central location to which to connect, along with
configuration information about which clients should execute which
commands in what order. Buildslaves connect to the buildmaster and
receive detailed instructions. Buildslave configuration consists of
installing the software, identifying the master server, and providing
connection credentials for the client to connect to the master. Builds
are scheduled by the buildmaster, and output is streamed from the
buildslaves to the buildmaster and kept on the master server for
presentation via the Web and other reporting and notification systems.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the architecture spectrum lies CDash, which is
used for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK)/Insight Toolkit (ITK)
projects by Kitware, Inc. CDash is essentially a reporting server,
designed to store and present information received from client
computers running CMake and CTest. With CDash, the clients initiate
the build and test suite, record build and test results, and then
connect to the CDash server to deposit the information for central
reporting.</p>

<p>Finally, a third system, Jenkins (known as Hudson before a name
change in 2011), provides both modes of operation. With Jenkins,
builds can either be executed independently with the results sent to
the master server; or nodes can be slaved to the Jenkins master
server, which then schedules and directs the execution of builds.</p>

<p>Both the centralized and decentralized models have some features in
common, and, as Jenkins shows, both models can co-exist in a single
implementation. However, Buildbot and CDash exist in stark contrast to
each other: apart from the commonalities of building software and
reporting on the builds, essentially every other aspect of the
architecture is different. Why?</p>

<p>Further, to what extent does the choice of architecture seem to make
certain features easier or harder to implement? Do some features
emerge naturally from a centralized model? And how extensible are the
existing implementations&mdash;can they easily be modified to provide new
reporting mechanisms, or scale to many packages, or execute builds and
tests in a cloud environment?</p>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>9.1.1. What Does Continuous Integration Software Do?</h3>

<p>The core functionality of a continuous integration system is simple:
build software, run tests, and report the results. The build, test,
and reporting can be performed by a script running from a scheduled
task or cron job: such a script would just check out a new copy of the
source code from the VCS, do a build, and then run the tests. Output
would be logged to a file, and either stored in a canonical location
or sent out via e-mail in case of a build failure. This is simple to
implement: in UNIX, for example, this entire process can be
implemented for most Python packages in a seven line script:</p>

<pre>
cd /tmp &amp;&amp; \
svn checkout http://some.project.url &amp;&amp; \
cd project_directory &amp;&amp; \
python setup.py build &amp;&amp; \
python setup.py test || \
echo build failed | sendmail notification@project.domain
cd /tmp &amp;&amp; rm -fr project_directory
</pre>

<p>In <a href="#fig.integration.internal">Figure&nbsp;9.1</a>, the unshaded rectangles
represent discrete subsystems and functionality within the system.
Arrows show information flow between the various components.  The
cloud represents potential remote execution of build processes.  The
shaded rectangles represent potential coupling between the subsystems;
for example, build monitoring may include monitoring of the build
process itself and aspects of system health (CPU load, I/O load,
memory usage, etc.)</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig.integration.internal">
  <img src="../images/integration/ci-internal.png" alt="[Internals of a Continuous Integration System]" />
  <p>Figure&nbsp;9.1: Internals of a Continuous Integration System</p>
</div>

<p>But this simplicity is deceptive. Real-world CI systems usually
do much more. In addition to initiating or receiving the results of
remote build processes, continuous integration software may support
any of the following additional features:</p>

<ul>

  <li><em>Checkout and update:</em> For large projects, checking out a
  new copy of the source code can be costly in terms of bandwidth
  and time. Usually, CI systems update an existing working copy in
  place, which communicates only the differences from the previous
  update. In exchange for this savings, the system must keep track
  of the working copy and know how to update it, which usually means
  at least minimal integration with a VCS.</li>

  <li><em>Abstract build recipes:</em> A configure/build/test recipe
  must be written for the software in question. The underlying
  commands will often be different for different operating systems,
  e.g. Mac OS X vs. Windows vs. UNIX, which means either specialized
  recipes need to be written (introducing potential bugs or
  disconnection from the actual build environment) or some suitable
  level of abstraction for recipes must be provided by the CI
  configuration system.</li>

  <li><em>Storing checkout/build/test status:</em> It may be desirable
  for details of the checkout (files updated, code version), build
  (warnings or errors) and test (code coverage, performance, memory
  usage) to be stored and used for later analysis. These results can
  be used to answer questions across the build architectures (did
  the latest check-in significantly affect performance on any
  particular architecture?) or over history (has code coverage
  changed dramatically in the last month?) As with the build recipe,
  the mechanisms and data types for this kind of introspection are
  usually specific to the platform or build system.</li>

  <li><em>Release packages:</em> Builds may produce binary packages or
  other products that need to be made externally available. For
  example, developers who don't have direct access to the build
  machine may want to test the latest build in a specific
  architecture; to support this, the CI system needs to be able to
  transfer build products to a central repository.</li>

  <li><em>Multiple architecture builds:</em> Since one goal
  of continuous integration is to build on multiple architectures to
  test cross-platform functionality, the CI software may need to
  track the architecture for each build machine and link
  builds and build outcomes to each client.</li>

  <li><em>Resource management:</em> If a build step is resource
  intensive on a single machine, the CI system may want to run
  conditionally. For example, builds may wait for the absence of
  other builds or users, or delay until a particular CPU or memory
  load is reached.</li>

  <li><em>External resource coordination:</em> Integration tests may
  depend on non-local resources such as a staging database or a
  remote web service. The CI system may therefore need to coordinate
  builds between multiple machines to organize access to these
  resources.</li>

  <li><em>Progress reports:</em> For long build processes, regular
  reporting from the build may also be important. If a user is
  primarily interested in the results of the first 30 minutes of a 5
  hour build and test, then it would be a waste of time to make them
  wait until the end of a run to see any results.</li>

</ul>

<p>A high-level view of all of these potential components of a CI system
is shown in <a href="#fig.integration.internal">Figure&nbsp;9.1</a>. CI software usually
implements some subset of these components.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>9.1.2. External Interactions</h3>

<p>Continuous integration systems also need to interact with other
systems. There are several types of potential interactions:</p>

<ul>

  <li><em>Build notification</em>: The outcomes of builds generally
  need to be communicated to interested clients, either via pull
  (Web, RSS, RPC, etc.) or push notification (e-mail, Twitter,
  PubSubHubbub, etc.) This can include notification of all builds,
  or only failed builds, or builds that haven't been executed within
  a certain period.</li>

  <li><em>Build information</em>: Build details and products may need
  to be retrieved, usually via RPC or a bulk download system. For
  example, it may be desirable to have an external analysis system
  do an in-depth or more targeted analysis, or report on code
  coverage or performance results. In addition, an external test
  result repository may be employed to keep track of failing and
  successful tests separately from the CI system.</li>

  <li><em>Build requests</em>: External build requests from users or a
  code repository may need to be handled. Most VCSs have post-commit
  hooks that can execute an RPC call to initiate a build, for
  example. Or, users may request builds manually through a Web
  interface or other user-initiated RPC.</li>

  <li><em>Remote control of the CI system</em>: More generally, the
  entire runtime may be modifiable through a more-or-less
  well-defined RPC interface. Either ad hoc extensions or a
  more formally specified interface may need to be able to drive
  builds on specific platforms, specify alternate source branches in order to
  build with various patches, and execute additional builds
  conditionally. This is useful in support of more general workflow
  systems, e.g. to permit commits only after they have passed the
  full set of CI tests, or to test patches across a wide variety of
  systems before final integration. Because of the variety of bug
  tracker, patch systems, and other external systems in use, it may
  not make sense to include this logic within the CI system itself.</li>

</ul>

<div class="sect">
<h2>9.2. Architectures</h2>

<p>Buildbot and CDash have chosen opposite architectures, and implement
overlapping but distinct sets of features. Below we examine these
feature sets and discuss how features are easier or harder to
implement given the choice of architecture.</p>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>9.2.1. Implementation Model: Buildbot</h3>

<div class="figure" id="fig.integration.buildbot">
  <img src="../images/integration/buildbot.png" alt="[Buildbot Architecture]" />
  <p>Figure&nbsp;9.2: Buildbot Architecture</p>
</div>

<p>Buildbot uses a master/slave architecture, with a single central
server and multiple build slaves. Remote execution is entirely
scripted by the master server in real time: the master configuration
specifies the command to be executed on each remote system, and runs
them when each previous command is finished. Scheduling and build
requests are not only coordinated through the master but directed
entirely <em>by</em> the master. No built-in recipe abstraction exists,
except for basic version control system integration ("our code is in
this repository") and a distinction between commands that operate on
the build directory vs. within the build directory. OS-specific
commands are typically specified directly in the configuration.</p>

<p>Buildbot maintains a constant connection with each buildslave, and
manages and coordinates job execution between them.  Managing remote
machines through a persistent connection adds significant practical
complexity to the implementation, and has been a long-standing source
of bugs.  Keeping robust long-term network connections running is not
simple, and testing applications which interact with the local GUI is
challenging through a network connection. OS alert windows are
particularly difficult to deal with.  However, this constant
connection makes resource coordination and scheduling straightforward,
because slaves are entirely at the disposal of the master for
execution of jobs.</p>

<p>The kind of tight control designed into the Buildbot model makes
centralized build coordination between resources very easy. Buildbot
implements both master and slave locks on the buildmaster, so that
builds can coordinate system-global and machine-local resources. This
makes Buildbot particularly suitable for large installations that run
system integration tests, e.g. tests that interact with databases or
other expensive resources.</p>

<p>The centralized configuration causes problems for a distributed use
model, however. Each new buildslave must be explicitly allowed for in
the master configuration, which makes it impossible for new
buildslaves to dynamically attach to the central server and offer
build services or build results. Moreover, because each build slave is
entirely driven by the build master, build clients are vulnerable to
malicious or accidental misconfigurations: the master literally
controls the client entirely, within the client OS security
restrictions.</p>

<p>One limiting feature of Buildbot is that there is no simple way to
return build products to the central server. For example, code
coverage statistics and binary builds are kept on the remote
buildslave, and there is no API to transmit them to the central
buildmaster for aggregation and distribution. It is not clear why this
feature is absent. It may be a consequence of the limited set of
command abstractions distributed with Buildbot, which are focused on
executing remote commands on the build slaves. Or, it may be due to
the decision to use the connection between the buildmaster and
buildslave as a control system, rather than as an RPC mechanism.</p>

<p>Another consequence of the master/slave model and this limited
communications channel is that buildslaves do not report system
utilization and the master cannot be configured to be aware of high
slave load.</p>

<p>External CPU notification of build results is handled entirely by the
buildmaster, and new notification services need to be implemented
within the buildmaster itself. Likewise, new build requests must be
communicated directly to the buildmaster.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>9.2.2. Implementation Model: CDash</h3>

<div class="figure" id="fig.integration.cdash">
  <img src="../images/integration/cdash.png" alt="[CDash Architecture]" />
  <p>Figure&nbsp;9.3: CDash Architecture</p>
</div>

<p>In contrast to Buildbot, CDash implements a reporting server model. In
this model, the CDash server acts as a central repository for
information on remotely executed builds, with associated reporting on
build and test failures, code coverage analysis, and memory
usage. Builds run on remote clients on their own schedule, and submit
build reports in an XML format. Builds can be submitted both by
"official" build clients and by non-core developers or users running
the published build process on their own machines.</p>

<p>This simple model is made possible because of the tight conceptual
integration between CDash and other elements of the Kitware build
infrastructure: CMake, a build configuration system, CTest, a test
runner, and CPack, a packaging system. This software provides a
mechanism by which build, test, and packaging recipes can be
implemented at a fairly high level of abstraction in an OS-agnostic
manner.</p>

<p>CDash's client-driven process simplifies many aspects of the
client-side CI process. The decision to run a build is made by build
clients, so client-side conditions (time of day, high load, etc.) can
be taken into account by the client before starting a build. Clients
can appear and disappear as they wish, easily enabling volunteer
builds and builds "in the cloud". Build products can be sent to the
central server via a straightforward upload mechanism.</p>

<p>However, in exchange for this reporting model, CDash lacks many
convenient features of Buildbot. There is no centralized coordination
of resources, nor can this be implemented simply in a distributed
environment with untrusted or unreliable clients. Progress reports are
also not implemented: to do so, the server would have to allow
incremental updating of build status. And, of course, there is no way
to both globally request a build, and guarantee that anonymous clients
<em>perform</em> the build in response to a check-in&mdash;clients must be
considered unreliable.</p>

<p>Recently, CDash added functionality to enable an "@Home" cloud build
system, in which clients offer build services to a CDash server.
Clients poll the server for build requests, execute them upon request,
and return the results to the server.  In the current implementation
(October 2010), builds must be manually requested on the server side,
and clients must be connected for the server to offer their services.
However, it is straightforward to extend this to a more generic
scheduled-build model in which builds are requested automatically by
the server whenever a relevant client is available.  The "@Home"
system is very similar in concept to the Pony-Build system described
later.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>9.2.3. Implementation Model: Jenkins</h3>

<p>Jenkins is a widely used continuous integration system implemented in
Java; until early 2011, it was known as Hudson. It is capable of
acting either as a standalone CI system with execution on a local
system, or as a coordinator of remote builds, or even as a passive
receiver of remote build information. It takes advantage of the JUnit
XML standard for unit test and code coverage reporting to integrate
reports from a variety of test tools. Jenkins originated with Sun, but
is very widely used and has a robust open-source community associated
with it.</p>

<p>Jenkins operates in a hybrid mode, defaulting to master-server build
execution but allowing a variety of methods for executing remote
builds, including both server- and client-initiated builds. Like
Buildbot, however, it is primarily designed for central server
control, but has been adapted to support a wide variety of distributed
job initiation mechanisms, including virtual machine management.</p>

<p>Jenkins can manage multiple remote machines through a connection
initiated by the master via an SSH connection, or from the client via
JNLP (Java Web Start). This connection is two-way, and supports the
communication of objects and data via serial transport.</p>

<p>Jenkins has a robust plugin architecture that abstracts the details of
this connection, which has allowed the development of many third-party
plugins to support the return of binary builds and more significant
result data.</p>

<p>For jobs that are controlled by a central server, Jenkins has a
"locks" plugin to discourage jobs from running in parallel, although
as of January 2011 it is not yet fully developed.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>9.2.4. Implementation Model: Pony-Build</h3>

<div class="figure" id="fig.integration.pb">
  <img src="../images/integration/webhooks.png" alt="[Pony-Build Architecture]" />
  <p>Figure&nbsp;9.4: Pony-Build Architecture</p>
</div>

<p>Pony-Build is a proof-of-concept decentralized CI system written in
Python. It is composed of three core components, which are illustrated
in <a href="#fig.integration.pb">Figure&nbsp;9.4</a>. The results server acts as a
centralized database containing build results received from individual
clients. The clients independently contain all configuration
information and build context, coupled with a lightweight client-side
library to help with VCS repository access, build process management,
and the communication of results to the server. The reporting server
is optional, and contains a simple Web interface, both for reporting
on the results of builds and potentially for requesting new builds. In
our implementation, the reporting server and results server run in a
single multithreaded process but are loosely coupled at the API level
and could easily be altered to run independently.</p>

<p>This basic model is decorated with a variety of webhooks and RPC
mechanisms to facilitate build and change notification and build
introspection. For example, rather than tying VCS change notification
from the code repository directly into the build system, remote build
requests are directed to the reporting system, which communicates them
to the results server. Likewise, rather than building push
notification of new builds out to e-mail, instant messaging, and other
services directly into the reporting server, notification is
controlled using the PubSubHubbub (PuSH) active notification
protocol. This allows a wide variety of consuming applications to
receive notification of "interesting" events (currently limited to
new builds and failed builds) via a PuSH webhook.</p>

<p>The advantages of this very decoupled model are substantial:</p>

<ul>

  <li><em>Ease of communication:</em> The basic architectural
  components and webhook protocols are extremely easy to implement,
  requiring only a basic knowledge of Web programming.</li>

  <li><em>Easy modification:</em> The implementation of new
  notification methods, or a new reporting server interface, is
  extremely simple.</li>

  <li><em>Multiple language support:</em> Since the various components
  call each other via webhooks, which are supported by most
  programming languages, different components can be implemented in
  different languages.</li>

  <li><em>Testability:</em> Each component can be completely isolated
  and mocked, so the system is very testable.</li>

  <li><em>Ease of configuration:</em> The client-side requirements are
  minimal, with only a single library file required beyond Python
  itself.</li>

  <li><em>Minimal server load:</em> Since the central server has
  virtually no control responsibilities over the clients, isolated
  clients can run in parallel without contacting the server and
  placing any corresponding load it, other than at reporting time.</li>

  <li><em>VCS integration:</em> Build configuration is entirely client
  side, allowing it to be included within the VCS.</li>

  <li><em>Ease of results access:</em> Applications that wish to
  consume build results can be written in any language capable of an
  XML-RPC request. Users of the build system can be granted access
  to the results and reporting servers at the network level, or via
  a customized interface at the reporting server. The build clients
  only need access to post results to the results server.</li>

</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, there are also many serious <em>disadvantages</em>, as
with the CDash model:</p>

<ul>

  <li><em>Difficulty requesting builds:</em> This difficulty is
  introduced by having the build clients be entirely independent of
  the results server. Clients may poll the results server, to see if
  a build request is operative, but this introduces high load and
  significant latency. Alternatively, command and control
  connections need to be established to allow the server to notify
  clients of build requests directly. This introduces more
  complexity into the system and eliminates the advantages of
  decoupled build clients.</li>

  <li><em>Poor support for resource locking:</em> It is easy to
  provide an RPC mechanism for holding and releasing resource locks,
  but much more difficult to enforce client policies. While CI
  systems like CDash assume good faith on the client side, clients
  may fail unintentionally and badly, e.g. without releasing
  locks. Implementing a robust distributed locking system is hard
  and adds significant undesired complexity. For example, in order
  to provide master resource locks with unreliable clients, the
  master lock controller must have a policy in place for clients
  that take a lock and never release it, either because they crash
  or because of a deadlock situation.</li>

  <li><em>Poor support for real-time monitoring:</em> Real-time
  monitoring of the build, and control of the build process
  itself, is challenging to implement in a system without a constant
  connection. One significant advantage of Buildbot over the
  client-driven model is that intermediate inspection of long builds
  is easy, because the results of the build are communicated to the
  master interface incrementally. Moreover, because Buildbot retains
  a control connection, if a long build goes bad in the middle
  due to misconfiguration or a bad check-in, it can be interrupted
  and aborted. Adding such a feature into Pony-Build, in which the
  results server has no guaranteed ability to contact the clients,
  would require either constant polling by the clients, or the
  addition of a standing connection to the clients.</li>

</ul>

<p>Two other aspects of CIs that were raised by Pony-Build were how best
to implement <em>recipes</em>, and how to manage <em>trust</em>. These are
intertwined issues, because recipes execute arbitrary code on build
clients.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>9.2.5. Build Recipes</h3>

<p>Build recipes add a useful level of abstraction, especially for
software built in a cross-platform language or using a multi-platform
build system. For example, CDash relies on a strict kind of
recipe; most, or perhaps all, software that uses CDash is built
with CMake, CTest, and CPack, and these tools are built to handle
multi-platform issues. This is the ideal situation from the viewpoint
of a continuous integration system, because the CI system can simply
delegate all issues to the build tool chain.</p>

<p>However, this is not true for all languages and build environments. In
the Python ecosystem, there has been increasing standardization around
distutils and distutils2 for building and packaging software, but as
yet no standard has emerged for discovering and running tests, and
collating the results. Moreover, many of the more complex Python
packages add specialized build logic into their system, through a
distutils extension mechanism that allows the execution of arbitrary
code. This is typical of most build tool chains: while there may be a
fairly standard set of commands to be run, there are always exceptions
and extensions.</p>

<p>Recipes for building, testing, and packaging are therefore
problematic, because they must solve two problems: first, they should
be specified in a platform independent way, so that a single recipe
can be used to build software on multiple systems; and second, they
must be customizable to the software being built.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>9.2.6. Trust</h3>

<p>This raises a third problem.  Widespread use of recipes by a CI system
introduces a second party that must be trusted by the system: not only
must the software itself be trustworthy (because the CI clients are
executing arbitrary code), but the recipes must also be trustworthy
(because they, too, must be able to execute arbitrary code).</p>

<p>These trust issues are easy to handle in a tightly controlled
environment, e.g. a company where the build clients and CI system are
part of an internal process. In other development environments,
however, interested third parties may want to offer build services,
for example to open source projects. The ideal solution would be to
support the inclusion of standard build recipes in software on a
community level, a direction that the Python community is taking with
distutils2. An alternative solution would be to allow for the use of
digitally signed recipes, so that trusted individuals could write and
distribute signed recipes, and CI clients could check to see if they
should trust the recipes.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>9.2.7. Choosing a Model</h3>

<p>In our experience, a loosely coupled RPC or webhook callback-based
model for continuous integration is extremely easy to implement, as
long as one ignores any requirements for tight coordination that would
involve complex coupling. Basic execution of remote checkouts and
builds has similar design constraints whether the build is being
driven locally or remotely; collection of information about the build
(success/failure, etc.) is primarily driven by client-side
requirements; and tracking information by architecture and result
involves the same basic requirements.  Thus a basic CI system can be
implemented quite easily using the reporting model.</p>

<p>We found the loosely coupled model to be very flexible and expandable,
as well. Adding new results reporting, notification mechanisms, and
build recipes is easy because the components are clearly separated and
quite independent. Separated components have clearly delegated tasks
to perform, and are also easy to test and easy to modify.</p>

<p>The only challenging aspect of remote builds in a CDash-like
loosely-coupled model is build coordination: starting and stopping
builds, reporting on ongoing builds, and coordinating resource locks
between different clients is technically demanding compared to the
rest of the implementation.</p>

<p>It is easy to reach the conclusion that the loosely coupled model is
"better" all around, but obviously this is only true if build
coordination is not needed.  This decision should be made based on the
needs of projects using the CI system.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>9.3. The Future</h2>

<p>While thinking about Pony-Build, we came up with a few features that
we would like to see in future continuous integration systems.</p>

<ul>

  <li><em>A language-agnostic set of build recipes:</em> Currently,
  each continuous integration system reinvents the wheel by
  providing its own build configuration language, which is
  manifestly ridiculous; there are fewer than a dozen commonly used
  build systems, and probably only a few dozen test
  runners. Nonetheless, each CI system has a new and different way
  of specifying the build and test commands to be run. In fact, this
  seems to be one of the reasons why so many basically identical CI
  systems exist: each language and community implements their own
  configuration system, tailored to their own build and test
  systems, and then layers on the same set of features above that
  system. Therefore, building a domain-specific language (DSL)
  capable of representing the options used by the few dozen commonly
  used build and test tool chains would go a long way toward
  simplifying the CI landscape.</li>

  <li><em>Common formats for build and test reporting:</em> There is
  little agreement on exactly what information, in what format, a
  build and test system needs to provide. If a common format or
  standard could be developed it would make it much easier for
  continuous integration systems to offer both detailed and summary
  views across builds. The Test Anywhere Protocol, TAP (from the
  Perl community) and the JUnit XML test output format (from the
  Java community) are two interesting options that are capable of
  encoding information about number of tests run, successes and
  failures, and per-file code coverage details.</li>

  <li><em>Increased granularity and introspection in reporting:</em>
  Alternatively, it would be convenient if different build platforms
  provided a well-documented set of hooks into their configuration,
  compilation, and test systems. This would provide an API (rather
  than a common format) that CI systems could use to extract more
  detailed information about builds.</li>

<h3>9.3.1. Concluding Thoughts</h3>

<p>The continuous integration systems described above implemented
features that fit their architecture, while the hybrid Jenkins system
started with a master/slave model but added features from the more
loosely coupled reporting architecture.</p>

<p>It is tempting to conclude that architecture dictates function. This
is nonsense, of course. Rather, the choice of architecture seems to
canalize or direct development towards a particular set of
features. For Pony-Build, we were surprised at the extent to which our
initial choice of a CDash-style reporting architecture drove later
design and implementation decisions. Some implementation choices, such
as the avoidance of a centralized configuration and scheduling system
in Pony-Build were driven by our use cases: we needed to allow dynamic
attachment of remote build clients, which is difficult to support with
Buildbot. Other features we didn't implement, such as progress reports
and centralized resource locking in Pony-Build, were desirable but
simply too complicated to add without a compelling requirement.</p>

<p>Similar logic may apply to Buildbot, CDash, and Jenkins. In each case
there are useful features that are absent, perhaps due to
architectural incompatibility. However, from discussions with members
of the Buildbot and CDash communities, and from reading the Jenkins
website, it seems likely that the desired features were chosen first,
and the system was then developed using an architecture that permitted
those features to be easily implemented. For example, CDash serves a
community with a relatively small set of core developers, who develop
software using a centralized model. Their primary consideration is to
keep the software working on a core set of machines, and secondarily
to receive bug reports from tech-savvy users. Meanwhile, Buildbot is
increasingly used in complex build environments with many clients that
require coordination to access shared resources. Buildbot's more
flexible configuration file format with its many options for
scheduling, change notification, and resource locks fits that need
better than the other options. Finally, Jenkins seems aimed at ease of
use and simple continuous integration, with a full GUI for configuring
it and configuration options for running on the local server.</p>

<p>The sociology of open source development is another confounding factor
in correlating architecture with features: suppose developers choose
open source projects based on how well the project architecture and
features fit their use case?  If so, then their contributions will
generally reflect an extension of a use case that already fits the
project well. Thus projects may get locked into a certain feature set,
since contributors are self-selected and may avoid projects with
architectures that don't fit their own desired features. This was
certainly true for us in choosing to implement a new system,
Pony-Build, rather than contributing to Buildbot: the Buildbot
architecture was simply not appropriate for building hundreds or
thousands of packages.</p>

<p>Existing continuous integration systems are generally built around one
of two disparate architectures, and generally implement only a subset
of desirable features.  As CI systems mature and their user
populations grow, we would expect them to grow additional features;
however, implementation of these features may be constrained by the
base choice of architecture.  It will be interesting to see how the
field evolves.</p>
