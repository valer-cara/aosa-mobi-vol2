<p>Programming tends to be considered a straightforward problem solving
activity; a developer has a requirement and codes a solution. Beauty
is often judged on the technical implementation's elegance or
effectiveness; this book is replete with excellent examples. Yet
beyond its immediate computing functions, code can have a profound
effect on people's lives. It can inspire people to participate and
create new content. Unfortunately, serious barriers exist that prevent
individuals from participating in a project.</p>

<p>Most programming languages require significant technical expertise to
utilize, which is out of reach for many. In addition, enhancing the
accessibility of code is technically difficult and is not necessary
for many programs. It rarely translates into neat coding scripts or
clever programming solutions. Achieving accessibility requires
considerable forethought in project and program design, which often
runs counter-intuitive to normal programming standards. Moreover most
projects rely upon an established staff of skilled professionals that
are expected to operate at a reasonably high level. They do not
require additional programming resources. Thus, code accessibility
becomes an afterthought, if considered at all.</p>

<p>Our project, the Battle for Wesnoth, attempted to address this issue
from its origins. The program is a turn-based fantasy strategy game,
produced in an open source model based on a GPL2 license. It has been
a moderate success, with over four million downloads at the time of
this writing. While this is an impressive metric, we believe the real
beauty of our project is the development model that allowed a band of
volunteers from widely different skill levels to interact in a
productive way.</p>

<p>Enhancing accessibility was not a vague objective set by developers,
it was viewed as essential for the project's survival. Wesnoth's open
source approach meant that the project could not immediately expect
large numbers of highly skilled developers.  Making the project
accessible to a wide a number of contributors, with varying skill
levels, would ensure its long-term viability.</p>

<p>Our developers attempted to lay the foundations for broadening
accessibility right from its earliest iteration. This would have
undeniable consequences for all aspect of the programming
architecture. Major decisions were made largely with this objective in
mind. This chapter will provide an in-depth examination of our program
with a focus on the efforts to increase accessibility.</p>

<p>The first part of this chapter offers a general overview of the
project's programming, covering its language, dependencies and
architecture. The second part will focus on Wesnoth's unique data
storage language, known as Wesnoth Markup Language (WML). It will
explain the specific functions of WML, with a particular emphasis on
its effects on in-game units. The next section covers multiplayer
implementation and external programs.  The chapter will end with some
concluding observations on our structure and the challenges of
broadening participation.</p>

<div class="sect">
<h2>25.1. Project Overview</h2>

<p>Wesnoth's core engine is written in C++, totalling around 200,000 lines
at the time of this publication. This represents the core game engine,
approximately half of the code base without any content.  The program
also allows in game content to be defined in a unique data language
known as Wesnoth Markup Language (WML). The game ships with another
250,000 lines of WML code. The proportion has shifted over the
project's existence. As the program matured, game content that was
hardcoded in C++ has increasingly been rewritten so that WML can
be used to define its operation. <a href="#fig.wes.arch">Figure&nbsp;25.1</a> gives a
rough picture of the program's architecture; green areas are
maintained by Wesnoth developers, while white areas are external
dependencies.</p>

</div>

<p>Overall, the project attempts to minimize dependencies in most cases
so as to maximize the portability of the application. This has the
added benefit of reducing the program's complexity, and decreases the
need for developers to learn the nuances of a large number of third
party APIs.  At the same time, the prudent use of some dependencies
can actually achieve the same effect. For example, Wesnoth uses the
Simple Directmedia Layer (SDL) for video, I/O and event handling. It
was chosen because it is easy to use and provides a common I/O
interface across many platforms.  This allows it to be portable to a
wide array of platforms, rather than the alternative of coding to
specific APIs on different platforms. This comes at a price however;
it is harder to take advantage of some platform specific features. SDL
also has an accompanying family of libraries that are used by Wesnoth
for various purposes:</p>

<ul>

  <li>SDL_Mixer for audio and sound</li>

  <li>SDL_Image for loading PNG and other image formats</li>

  <li>SDL_Net for network I/O</li>

</ul>

<p>Additionally, Wesnoth uses several other libraries:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Boost for a variety of advanced C++ features</li>

  <li>Pango with Cairo for internationalized fonts</li>

  <li>zlib for compression</li>

  <li>Python and Lua for scripting support</li>

  <li>GNU gettext for internationalization</li>

</ul>

<p>Throughout Wesnoth's engine, the use of WML objects&mdash;that is, string
dictionaries with child nodes&mdash;is fairly ubiquitous.  Many objects
can be constructed from a WML node, and also serialize themselves to a
WML node. Some parts of the engine keep data in this WML dictionary
based format, interpreting it directly rather than parsing it into a
C++ data structure.</p>

<p>Wesnoth utilizes several important subsystems, most of which are as
self-contained as possible. This segmented structure has advantages
for accessibility. An interested party can easily work a code in a
specific area and introduce changes without damaging the rest of the
program. The major subdivisions include:</p>

<ul>

  <li>A WML parser with preprocessor</li>

  <li>Basic I/O modules that abstract underlying libraries and
  system calls&mdash;a video module, a sound module, a network module</li>

  <li>A GUI module containing widget implementations for buttons,
  lists, menus, etc.</li>

  <li>A display module for rendering the game board, units,
  animations, and so forth</li>

  <li>An AI module</li>

  <li>A pathfinding module that includes many utility functions for
  dealing with a hexagonal gaming board</li>

  <li>A map generation module for generating different kinds of
  random maps</li>

</ul>

<p>There are also different modules for controlling different parts of
the game flow:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The titlescreen module, for controlling display of the
  title screen.</li>

  <li>The storyline module, for showing cut-scene sequences.</li>

  <li>The lobby module, for displaying and allowing setup of games
  on the multiplayer server.</li>

  <li>The "play game" module that controls the main gameplay.</li>

</ul>

<p>The "play game" module and the main display module are the largest
within Wesnoth.  Their purpose is the least well defined, as their
function is ever-changing and thus difficult to have a clear
specification for. Consequently, the modules has often been in danger
of suffering from the Blob anti-pattern over the program's
history&mdash;i.e., becoming huge dominant segments without well-defined
behaviors.  The code in the display and play game modules are
regularly reviewed to see if any of it can be separated into a module
of its own.</p>

<p>There are also ancillary features that are part of the overall
project, but are separate from the main program. This includes a
multiplayer server that facilitates multiplayer network games, as well
as a content server that allows users to upload their content to a
common server and share it with others. Both are written in C++.</p>

<div class="sect">
<h2>25.2. Wesnoth Markup Language</h2>

<p>As an extensible game engine, Wesnoth uses a simple data language to
store and load all game data. Although XML was considered initially,
we decided that we wanted something a little more friendly to non-technical
users, and a little more relaxed with regard to use of visual data.
We therefore developed our own data language,
called Wesnoth Markup Language (WML). It was designed with the least
technical of users in mind: the hope was that even users who find
Python or HTML intimidating would be able to make sense of a WML
file. All Wesnoth game data is stored in WML, including unit
definitions, campaigns, scenarios, GUI definitions, and other game
logic configuration.</p>

<p>WML shares the same basic attributes as XML: elements and attributes,
though it doesn't support text within elements. WML attributes are
represented simply as a dictionary mapping strings to strings, with
the program logic responsible for interpretation of attributes. A
simple example of WML is a trimmed definition for the Elvish Fighter
unit within the game:</p>

<pre>
[unit_type]
    id=Elvish Fighter
    name= _ "Elvish Fighter"
    race=elf
    image="units/elves-wood/fighter.png"
    profile="portraits/elves/fighter.png"
    hitpoints=33
    movement_type=woodland
    movement=5
    experience=40
    level=1
    alignment=neutral
    advances_to=Elvish Captain,Elvish Hero
    cost=14
    usage=fighter
    {LESS_NIMBLE_ELF}
    [attack]
        name=sword
        description=_"sword"
        icon=attacks/sword-elven.png
        type=blade
        range=melee
        damage=5
        number=4
    [/attack]
[/unit_type]
</pre>

<p>Since internationalization is important in Wesnoth, WML does have
direct support for it: attribute values which have an underscore
prefix are translatable. Any translatable string is converted using
GNU <code>gettext</code> to the translated version of the string when the
WML is parsed.</p>

<p>Rather than have many different WML documents, Wesnoth opts for the
approach of all main game data being presented to the game engine in
just a single document. This allows for a single global variable to
hold the document, and when the game is loaded all unit definitions,
for instance, are loaded by looking for elements with the name
<code>unit_type</code> within a <code>units</code> element.</p>

<p>Though all data is stored in a single conceptual WML
document, it would be unwieldy to have it all in a single file.
Wesnoth therefore supports a preprocessor that is run over all WML
before parsing. This preprocessor allows one file to include the
contents of another file, or an entire directory. For instance:</p>

<pre>
{gui/default/window/}
</pre>

<p class="continue">will include all the <code>.cfg</code> files within <code>gui/default/window/</code>.</p>

<p>Since WML can become very verbose, the preprocessor also allows
macros to be defined to condense things. For instance, the
<code>{LESS_NIMBLE_ELF}</code> invocation in the definition of the
Elvish Fighter is a call to a macro that makes certain elf units less
nimble under certain conditions, such as when they are stationed in a
forest:</p>

<pre>
#define LESS_NIMBLE_ELF
    [defense]
        forest=40
    [/defense]
#enddef
</pre>

<p>This design has the advantage of making the engine agnostic to how the
WML document is broken up into files. It is the responsibility of WML
authors to decide how to structure and divide all game data into
different files and directories.</p>

<p>When the game engine loads the WML document, it also defines some
preprocessor symbols according to various game settings.  For
instance, a Wesnoth campaign can define different difficulty settings,
with each difficulty setting resulting in a different preprocessor
symbol being defined. As an example, a common way to vary difficulty
is by varying the amount of resources given to an opponent
(represented by gold). To facilitate this, there is a WML macro
defined like this:</p>

<pre>
#define GOLD EASY_AMOUNT NORMAL_AMOUNT HARD_AMOUNT
  #ifdef EASY
    gold={EASY_AMOUNT}
  #endif
  #ifdef NORMAL
    gold={NORMAL_AMOUNT}
  #endif
  #ifdef HARD
    gold={HARD_AMOUNT}
  #endif
#enddef
</pre>

<p class="continue">This macro can be invoked using, for instance, <code>{GOLD 50 100
200}</code> within the definition of an opponent to define how much gold
the opponent has based on the difficulty level.</p>

<p>Since the WML is processed conditionally, if any of the
symbols provided to the WML document change during execution of the
Wesnoth engine, the entire WML document must be re-loaded and
processed. For instance, when the user starts the game, the WML
document is loaded and available campaigns among other things are
loaded. But then, if the user chooses to start a campaign and chooses
a certain difficulty level&mdash;easy for instance&mdash;then the entire
document will have to be re-loaded with EASY defined.</p>

<p>This design is convenient in that a single document contains all game
data, and that symbols can allow easy configuration of the WML
document. However, as a successful project, more and more content is
available for Wesnoth, including much downloadable content&mdash;all of
which ends up inserted into the core document tree&mdash;which means the
WML document is many megabytes in size. This has become a performance
issue for Wesnoth: Loading the document may take up to a minute on
some computers, causing delays in-game any time the document needs to
be reloaded. Additionally, it uses a substantial amount of
memory. Some measures are used to counter this: when a campaign is
loaded, it has a symbol unique to that campaign defined in the
preprocessor. This means that any content specific to that campaign
can be <code>#ifdef</code>ed to only be used when that campaign is needed.</p>

<p>Additionally, Wesnoth uses a caching system to cache the fully
preprocessed version of the WML document for a given set of key
definitions. Naturally this caching system must inspect the timestamp
of all WML files so that if any have changed, the cached document is
regenerated.</p>

<div class="sect">
<h2>25.3. Units in Wesnoth</h2>

<p>The protagonists of Wesnoth are its units. An Elvish Fighter and an
Elvish Shaman might battle against a Troll Warrior and an Orcish
Grunt.  All units share the same basic behavior, but many have special
abilities that alter the normal flow of gameplay. For example, a troll
regenerates some of its health every turn, an Elvish shaman slows its
opponents with an entangling root, and a Wose is invisible in a
forest.</p>

<p>What is the best way to represent this in an engine? It is
tempting to make a base <code>unit</code> class in C++, with different types
of units derived from it. For instance, a <code>wose_unit</code> class could
derive from <code>unit</code>, and <code>unit</code> could have a virtual
function, <code>bool is_invisible() const</code>, which returns false, which
the <code>wose_unit</code> overrides, returning true if the unit happens to
be in forest.</p>

<p>Such an approach would work reasonably well for a game with a limited
set of rules. Unfortunately Wesnoth is quite a large game and such an
approach is not easily extendable. If a person wanted to add a new
type of unit under this approach, it would require the addition of a
new C++ class to the game. Additionally, it does not allow different
characteristics to be combined well: what if you had a unit that
regenerated, could slow enemies with a net, and was invisible in a
forest? You would have to write an entirely new class that duplicates
code in the other classes.</p>

<p>Wesnoth's unit system doesn't use inheritance at all to accomplish
this task. Instead, it uses a <code>unit</code> class to represent instances
of units, and a <code>unit_type</code> class, which represents the
immutable characteristics that all units of a certain type share. The
<code>unit</code> class has a reference to the type of object that it is.
All the possible <code>unit_type</code> objects are stored in a globally
held dictionary that is loaded when the main WML document is loaded.</p>

<p>A unit type has a list of all the abilities that that unit has. For
instance, a Troll has the "regeneration" ability that makes it heal
life every turn. A Saurian Skirmisher has the "skirmisher" ability
that allows it to move through enemy lines. Recognition of these
abilities is built into the engine&mdash;for instance, the pathfinding
algorithms will check if a unit has the "skirmisher" flag set to see
if it can move freely past enemy lines. This approach allows an
individual to add new units, which have any combination of abilities
made by the engine, by only editing WML. Of course, it doesn't allow
adding completely new abilities and unit behavior without modifying
the engine.</p>

<p>Additionally, each unit in Wesnoth may have any number of ways to
attack.  For instance, an Elvish Archer has a long-range bow attack
and also a short-range sword attack. Each deals different damage
amounts and characteristics. To represent an attack, there is an
<code>attack_type</code> class, with every <code>unit_type</code> instance
having a list of possible <code>attack_types</code>.</p>

<p>To give each unit more character, Wesnoth has a feature known as
traits. Upon recruitment, most units are assigned two traits at random
from a predefined list. For instance, a strong unit does more damage
with its melee attacks, while an intelligent unit needs less
experience before it "levels up." Also, it is possible for units to
acquire equipment during the game that make them more powerful. For
instance, there might be a sword a unit can pick up that makes their
attacks do more damage. To implement traits and equipment Wesnoth
allows modifications on units, which are WML-defined alterations to a
unit's statistics. The modification can even be applied to certain
types of attacks. For instance, the strong trait gives strong units
more damage when attacking in melee, but not when using a ranged
strike.</p>

<p>Allowing completely configurable unit behavior with WML would be an
admirable goal, so it is instructional to consider why Wesnoth has
never achieved such a goal.  WML would need to be much more flexible
than it is if it were to allow arbitrary unit behavior. Rather than
being a data-oriented language, WML would have to be extended into a
full-fledged programming language and that would be intimidating for
many aspiring contributors.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Wesnoth AI, which is developed in C++, recognizes
the abilities present in the game. It takes into account regeneration,
invisibility, and so forth, and attempts to maneuver its units to take
best advantage of these different abilities. Even if a unit ability
could be created using WML, it would be difficult to make the AI
sophisticated enough to recognize this ability to take advantage of
it.  Implementing an ability but not having it accounted for by the AI
would not be a very satisfying implementation.  Similarly,
implementing an ability in WML and then having to modify the AI in C++
to account for the ability would be awkward. Thus, having units
definable in WML, but having abilities hard-wired into the engine is
considered a reasonable compromise that works best for Wesnoth's
specific requirements.</p>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>25.4. Wesnoth's Multiplayer Implementation</h2>

<p>The Wesnoth multiplayer implementation uses a simple-as-possible
approach to implementing multiplayer in Wesnoth. It attempts to
mitigate the possibility of malicious attacks on the server, but
doesn't make a serious attempt to prevent cheating.  Any movement that
is made in a Wesnoth game&mdash;moving of a unit, attacking an enemy,
recruiting a unit, and so forth&mdash;can be saved as a WML node. For
instance, a command to move a unit might be saved into WML like this:</p>

<pre>
[move]
    x="11,11,10,9,8,7"
    y="6,7,7,8,8,9"
[/move]
</pre>

<p class="continue">This shows the path that a unit follows as a result of a player's
commands. The game then has a facility to execute any such WML command
given to it. This is very useful because it means that a complete
replay can be saved, by storing the initial state of the game and then
all subsequent commands. Being able to replay games is useful both for
players to observe each other playing, as well as to help in certain
kinds of bug reports.</p>

<p>We decided that the community would try to focus on friendly, casual
games for the network multiplayer implementation of Wesnoth.  Rather
than fight a technical battle against anti-social crackers trying to
compromise cheat prevention systems, the project would simply not try
hard to prevent cheating. An analysis of other multiplayer games
indicated that competitive ranking systems were a key source of
anti-social behavior. Deliberately preventing such functions on the
server greatly reduced the motivation for individuals to cheat.
Moreover the moderators try to encourage a positive gaming community
where individuals develop personal rapport with other players and play
with them. This placed a greater emphasis on relationships rather than
competition. The outcome of these efforts has been deemed successful,
as thus far efforts to maliciously hack the game have been largely
isolated.</p>

<p>Wesnoth's multiplayer implementation consists of a typical
client-server infrastructure. A server, known as wesnothd, accepts
connections from the Wesnoth client, and sends the client a summary of
available games.  Wesnoth will display a 'lobby' to the player who can
choose to join a game or create a new game for others to join. Once
players are in a game and the game starts, each instance of Wesnoth
will generate WML commands describing the actions the player
makes. These commands are sent to the server, and then the server
relays them on to all the other clients in the game. The server will
thus act as a very thin, simple relay. The replay system is used on
the other clients to execute the WML commands.  Since Wesnoth is a
turn-based game, TCP/IP is used for all network communication.</p>

<p>This system also allows observers to easily watch a game. An observer
can join a game in-progress, in which case the server will send the
WML representing the initial state of the game, followed by a history
of all commands that have been carried out since the start of the
game. This allows new observers to get up to speed on the state of
the game. They can see a history of the game, although it does take
time for the observer to get to the game's current position&mdash;the
history of commands can be fast forwarded but it still takes
time. The alternative would be to have one of the clients generate a
snapshot of the game's current state as WML and send it to the new
observer; however this approach would burden clients with overhead
based on observers, and could facilitate denial-of-service attacks by
having many observers join a game.</p>

<p>Of course, since Wesnoth clients do not share any kind of game state
with each other, only sending commands, it is important that they
agree on the rules of the game. The server is segmented by version,
with only players using the same version of the game able to
interact. Players are immediately alerted if their client's game
becomes out of sync with others. This also is a useful system to
prevent cheating. Although it is rather easy for a player to cheat by
modifying their client, any difference between versions will
immediately be identified to players where it can be dealt with.</p>

<h2>25.5. Conclusion</h2>

<p>We believe that the beauty of the Battle for Wesnoth as a program is
how it made coding accessible to a wide variety of individuals. To
achieve this aim, the project often made compromises that do not look
elegant whatsoever in the code. It should be noted that many of the
project's more talented programmers frown upon WML for its inefficient
syntax. Yet this compromise enabled one of the project's greatest
successes. Today Wesnoth can boast of hundreds of user-made campaigns
and eras, created mostly by users with little or no programming
experience. Furthermore it has inspired a number of people to take up
programming as a profession, using the project as a learning
tool. Those are tangible accomplishments that few programs can equal.</p>

<p>One of the key lessons a reader should take away from Wesnoth's
efforts is to consider the challenges faced by lesser skilled
programmers. It requires an awareness of what blocks contributors from
actually performing coding and developing their skills. For example an
individual might want to contribute to the program but does not
possess any programming skills. Dedicated technological editors like
<code>emacs</code> or <code>vim</code> possess a significant learning curve that
might prove daunting for such an individual. Thus WML was designed to
allow a simple text editor to open up its files, giving anybody the
tools to contribute.</p>

<p>However, increasing a code base's accessibility is not a simple
objective to achieve. There are no hard and fast rules for increasing
code's accessibility. Rather it requires a balance between different
considerations, which can have negative consequences that the
community must be aware of. This is apparent in how the program dealt
with dependencies. In some cases, dependencies can actually increase
barriers to participation, while in others they can allow people to
contribute more easily. Every issue must be considered on a
case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>We should also be careful not to overstate some of Wesnoth's
successes.  The project enjoyed some advantages that are not easily
replicated by other programs. Making code accessible to a wider public
is partly a result of the program's setting. As an open source
program, Wesnoth had several advantages in this regard. Legally the
GNU license allows someone to open up an existing file, understand how
it works and makes changes.  Individuals are encouraged to experiment,
learn and share within this culture, which might not be appropriate
for other programs. Nevertheless we hope that there are certain
elements that might prove useful for all developers and help them in
their effort to find beauty in coding.</p>
