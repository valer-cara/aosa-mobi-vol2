<p>Graphite<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> performs two
pretty simple tasks: storing numbers that change over time and
graphing them. There has been a lot of software written over the years
to do these same tasks.  What makes Graphite unique is that it
provides this functionality as a network service that is both easy to
use and highly scalable.  The protocol for feeding data into Graphite
is simple enough that you could learn to do it by hand in a few
minutes (not that you'd actually want to, but it's a decent litmus
test for simplicity).  Rendering graphs and retrieving data points are
as easy as fetching a URL.  This makes it very natural to integrate
Graphite with other software and enables users to build powerful
applications on top of Graphite.  One of the most common uses of
Graphite is building web-based dashboards for monitoring and analysis.
Graphite was born in a high-volume e-commerce environment and its
design reflects this.  Scalability and real-time access to data are
key goals.</p>

<p>The components that allow Graphite to achieve these goals include a
specialized database library and its storage format, a caching
mechanism for optimizing I/O operations, and a simple yet effective
method of clustering Graphite servers. Rather than simply
describing how Graphite works today, I will explain how Graphite was
initially implemented (quite naively), what problems I ran into, and
how I devised solutions to them.</p>

<div class="sect">
<h2>7.1. The Database Library: Storing Time-Series Data</h2>

<p>Graphite is written entirely in Python and consists of three major
components: a database library named <code>whisper</code>, a back-end daemon named
<code>carbon</code>, and a front-end webapp that renders graphs and provides a
basic UI. While <code>whisper</code> was written specifically for Graphite, it can
also be used independently. It is very similar in design to the
round-robin-database used by RRDtool, and only stores time-series
numeric data.  Usually we think of databases as server processes that
client applications talk to over sockets. However, <code>whisper</code>, much like
RRDtool, is a database library used by applications to manipulate and
retrieve data stored in specially formatted files. The most basic
<code>whisper</code> operations are <code>create</code> to make a new <code>whisper</code> file,
<code>update</code> to write new data points into a file, and <code>fetch</code>
to retrieve data points.</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig.gra.whis">
  <img src="../images/graphite/whisper-file.png" alt="[Basic Anatomy of a whisper File]" />
  <p>Figure&nbsp;7.1: Basic Anatomy of a <code>whisper</code> File</p>
</div>

<p>As shown in <a href="#fig.gra.whis">Figure&nbsp;7.1</a>, <code>whisper</code> files consist of a
header section containing various metadata, followed by one or more
archive sections . Each archive is a sequence of consecutive data
points which are <code>(timestamp, value)</code> pairs. When an
<code>update</code> or <code>fetch</code> operation is performed, <code>whisper</code>
determines the offset in the file where data should be written to or
read from, based on the timestamp and the archive configuration.</p>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>7.2. The Back End: A Simple Storage Service</h2>

<p>Graphite's back end is a daemon process called <code>carbon-cache</code>, usually
simply referred to as <code>carbon</code>.  It is built on Twisted, a highly
scalable event-driven I/O framework for Python. Twisted enables <code>carbon</code>
to efficiently talk to a large number of clients and handle a large
amount of traffic with low overhead.  <a href="#fig.gra.carbon">Figure&nbsp;7.2</a>
shows the data flow among <code>carbon</code>, <code>whisper</code> and the webapp: Client
applications collect data and send it to the Graphite back end, <code>carbon</code>,
which stores the data using <code>whisper</code>. This data can then be used by the
Graphite webapp to generate graphs.</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig.gra.carbon">
  <img src="../images/graphite/dataflow.png" alt="[Data Flow]" />
  <p>Figure&nbsp;7.2: Data Flow</p>
</div>

<p>The primary function of <code>carbon</code> is to store data points for metrics
provided by clients. In Graphite terminology, a metric is any
measurable quantity that can vary over time (like the CPU utilization
of a server or the number of sales of a product). A data point is
simply a <code>(timestamp, value)</code> pair corresponding to the measured
value of a particular metric at a point in time. Metrics are uniquely
identified by their name, and the name of each metric as well as its
data points are provided by client applications. A common type of
client application is a monitoring agent that collects system or
application metrics, and sends its collected values to <code>carbon</code> for easy
storage and visualization.  Metrics in Graphite have simple
hierarchical names, similar to filesystem paths except that a dot is
used to delimit the hierarchy rather than a slash or backslash.
<code>carbon</code> will respect any legal name and creates a <code>whisper</code> file for each
metric to store its data points. The <code>whisper</code> files are stored within
<code>carbon</code>'s data directory in a filesystem hierarchy that mirrors the
dot-delimited hierarchy in each metric's name, so that (for example)
<code>servers.www01.cpuUsage</code> maps to
<code>&hellip;/servers/www01/cpuUsage.wsp</code>.</p>

<p>When a client application wishes to send data points to Graphite it
must establish a TCP connection to <code>carbon</code>, usually on port
2003<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup>.  The client does all
the talking; <code>carbon</code> does not send anything over the connection. The
client sends data points in a simple plain-text format while the
connection may be left open and re-used as needed. The format is one
line of text per data point where each line contains the dotted metric
name, value, and a Unix epoch timestamp separated by spaces.  For
example, a client might send:</p>

<pre>
servers.www01.cpuUsage 42 1286269200
products.snake-oil.salesPerMinute 123 1286269200
[one minute passes]
servers.www01.cpuUsageUser 44 1286269260
products.snake-oil.salesPerMinute 119 1286269260
</pre>

<p>On a high level, all <code>carbon</code> does is listen for data in this format and
try to store it on disk as quickly as possible using <code>whisper</code>. Later on
we will discuss the details of some tricks used to ensure scalability
and get the best performance we can out of a typical hard drive.</p>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>7.3. The Front End: Graphs On-Demand</h2>

<p>The Graphite webapp allows users to request custom graphs with a
simple URL-based API. Graphing parameters are specified in the
query-string of an HTTP GET request, and a PNG image is returned in
response. For example, the URL:</p>

<pre>
http://graphite.example.com/render?target=servers.www01.cpuUsage&amp;
width=500&amp;height=300&amp;from=-24h
</pre>

<p class="continue">requests a 500&times;300 graph for the metric
<code>servers.www01.cpuUsage</code> and the past 24 hours of data. Actually,
only the target parameter is required; all the others are optional and
use your default values if omitted.</p>

<p>Graphite supports a wide variety of display options as well as data
manipulation functions that follow a simple functional syntax. For
example, we could graph a 10-point moving average of the metric in our
previous example like this:</p>

<pre>
target=movingAverage(servers.www01.cpuUsage,10)
</pre>

<p class="continue">Functions can be nested, allowing for complex expressions and
calculations.</p>

<p>Here is another example that gives the running total of sales for the
day using per-product metrics of sales-per-minute:</p>

<pre>
target=integral(sumSeries(products.*.salesPerMinute))&amp;amp;from=midnight
</pre>

<p class="continue">The <code>sumSeries</code> function computes a time-series that is the sum
of each metric matching the pattern
<code>products.*.salesPerMinute</code>. Then <code>integral</code> computes a
running total rather than a per-minute count. From here it isn't too
hard to imagine how one might build a web UI for viewing and
manipulating graphs. Graphite comes with its own Composer UI, shown in
<a href="#fig.gra.ui">Figure&nbsp;7.3</a>, that does this using Javascript to modify the
graph's URL parameters as the user clicks through menus of the
available features.</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig.gra.ui">
  <img src="../images/graphite/composer-ui.png" alt="[Graphite's Composer Interface]" />
  <p>Figure&nbsp;7.3: Graphite's Composer Interface</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>7.4. Dashboards</h2>

<p>Since its inception Graphite has been used as a tool for creating
web-based dashboards. The URL API makes this a natural use
case. Making a dashboard is as simple as making an HTML page full of
tags like this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;img src="../http://graphite.example.com/render?parameters-for-my-awesome-graph"&gt;
</pre>

<p>However, not everyone likes crafting URLs by hand, so Graphite's Composer UI
provides a point-and-click method to create a graph from which you can
simply copy and paste the URL. When coupled with another tool that
allows rapid creation of web pages (like a wiki) this becomes easy
enough that non-technical users can build their own dashboards pretty
easily.</p>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>7.5. An Obvious Bottleneck</h2>

<p>Once my users started building dashboards, Graphite quickly began to
have performance issues. I investigated the web server logs to see
what requests were bogging it down. It was pretty obvious that the
problem was the sheer number of graphing requests. The webapp was
CPU-bound, rendering graphs constantly. I noticed that there were a
lot of identical requests, and the dashboards were to blame.</p>

<p>Imagine you have a dashboard with 10 graphs in it and the page
refreshes once a minute. Each time a user opens the dashboard in
their browser, Graphite has to handle 10 more requests per
minute. This quickly becomes expensive.</p>

<p>A simple solution is to render each graph only once and then serve a
copy of it to each user. The Django web framework (which Graphite is
built on) provides an excellent caching mechanism that can use various
back ends such as memcached. Memcached<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>
is essentially a hash table
provided as a network service. Client applications can get and set
key-value pairs just like an ordinary hash table. The main benefit of
using memcached is that the result of an expensive request (like
rendering a graph) can be stored very quickly and retrieved later to
handle subsequent requests. To avoid returning the same stale graphs
forever, memcached can be configured to expire the cached graphs after
a short period. Even if this is only a few seconds, the burden it
takes off Graphite is tremendous because duplicate requests are so
common.</p>

<p>Another common case that creates lots of rendering requests is when a
user is tweaking the display options and applying functions in the
Composer UI. Each time the user changes something, Graphite must
redraw the graph. The same data is involved in each request so it
makes sense to put the underlying data in the memcache as well.  This
keeps the UI responsive to the user because the step of retrieving
data is skipped.</p>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>7.6. Optimizing I/O</h2>

<p>Imagine that you have 60,000 metrics that you send to your Graphite
server, and each of these metrics has one data point per
minute. Remember that each metric has its own <code>whisper</code> file on the
filesystem. This means <code>carbon</code> must do one write operation to 60,000
different files each minute.  As long as <code>carbon</code> can write to one file
each millisecond, it should be able to keep up. This isn't too far
fetched, but let's say you have 600,000 metrics updating each minute,
or your metrics are updating every second, or perhaps you simply
cannot afford fast enough storage. Whatever the case, assume the rate
of incoming data points exceeds the rate of write operations that your
storage can keep up with. How should this situation be handled?</p>

<p>Most hard drives these days have slow seek time<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-4">4</a></sup>, that is, the delay between doing I/O
operations at two different locations, compared to writing a
contiguous sequence of data. This means the more contiguous writing we
do, the more throughput we get. But if we have thousands of files that
need to be written to frequently, and each write is very small (one
<code>whisper</code> data point is only 12 bytes) then our disks are definitely
going to spend most of their time seeking.</p>

<p>Working under the assumption that the rate of write operations has a
relatively low ceiling, the only way to increase our data point
throughput beyond that rate is to write multiple data points in a
single write operation. This is feasible because <code>whisper</code> arranges
consecutive data points contiguously on disk. So I added an
<code>update_many</code> function to <code>whisper</code>, which takes a list of data
points for a single metric and compacts contiguous data points into a
single write operation.  Even though this made each write larger, the
difference in time it takes to write ten data points (120 bytes)
versus one data point (12 bytes) is negligible. It takes quite a few
more data points before the size of each write starts to noticeably
affect the latency.</p>

<p>Next I implemented a buffering mechanism in <code>carbon</code>. Each incoming data
point gets mapped to a queue based on its metric name and is then
appended to that queue.  Another thread repeatedly iterates through
all of the queues and for each one it pulls all of the data points out
and writes them to the appropriate <code>whisper</code> file with
<code>update_many</code>. Going back to our example, if we have 600,000
metrics updating every minute and our storage can only keep up with 1
write per millisecond, then the queues will end up holding about 10
data points each on average. The only resource this costs us is
memory, which is relatively plentiful since each data point is only a
few bytes.</p>

<p>This strategy dynamically buffers as many datapoints as necessary to sustain
a rate of incoming datapoints that may exceed the rate of I/O operations your
storage can keep up with. A nice advantage of this approach is that it adds a degree of
resiliency to handle temporary I/O slowdowns. If the system needs to
do other I/O work outside of Graphite then it is likely that the rate
of write operations will decrease, in which case <code>carbon</code>'s queues will
simply grow. The larger the queues, the larger the writes. Since the
overall throughput of data points is equal to the rate of write
operations times the average size of each write, <code>carbon</code> is able to
keep up as long as there is enough memory for the queues.  <code>carbon</code>'s
queueing mechanism is depicted in <a href="#fig.gra.queue">Figure&nbsp;7.4</a>.</p>

<div class="figure" id="fig.gra.queue">
  <img src="../images/graphite/carbon-queues.png" alt="[Carbon's Queueing Mechanism]" />
  <p>Figure&nbsp;7.4: Carbon's Queueing Mechanism</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>7.7. Keeping It Real-Time</h2>

<p>Buffering data points was a nice way to optimize <code>carbon</code>'s I/O but it
didn't take long for my users to notice a rather troubling side
effect.  Revisiting our example again, we've got 600,000 metrics that
update every minute and we're assuming our storage can only keep up
with 60,000 write operations per minute. This means we will have
approximately 10 minutes worth of data sitting in <code>carbon</code>'s queues at
any given time.  To a user this means that the graphs they request
from the Graphite webapp will be missing the most recent 10 minutes of
data: Not good!</p>

<p>Fortunately the solution is pretty straight-forward. I simply added a
socket listener to <code>carbon</code> that provides a query interface for
accessing the buffered data points and then modifies the Graphite
webapp to use this interface each time it needs to retrieve data.  The
webapp then combines the data points it retrieves from <code>carbon</code> with the
data points it retrieved from disk and voila, the graphs are
real-time. Granted, in our example the data points are updated to the
minute and thus not exactly "real-time", but the fact that each data
point is instantly accessible in a graph once it is received by <code>carbon</code>
is real-time.</p>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>7.8. Kernels, Caches, and Catastrophic Failures</h2>

<p>As is probably obvious by now, a key characteristic of system
performance that Graphite's own performance depends on is I/O latency.
So far we've assumed our system has consistently low I/O latency
averaging around 1 millisecond per write, but this is a big assumption
that requires a little deeper analysis. Most hard drives simply aren't
that fast; even with dozens of disks in a RAID array there is very
likely to be more than 1 millisecond latency for random access. Yet if
you were to try and test how quickly even an old laptop could write a
whole kilobyte to disk you would find that the write system call
returns in far less than 1 millisecond. Why?</p>

<p>Whenever software has inconsistent or unexpected performance
characteristics, usually either buffering or caching is to blame. In
this case, we're dealing with both. The write system call doesn't
technically write your data to disk, it simply puts it in a buffer
which the kernel then writes to disk later on. This is why the write
call usually returns so quickly. Even after the buffer has been
written to disk, it often remains cached for subsequent reads. Both of
these behaviors, buffering and caching, require memory of
course.</p>

<p>Kernel developers, being the smart folks that they are, decided it
would be a good idea to use whatever user-space memory is currently
free instead of allocating memory outright. This turns out to be a
tremendously useful performance booster and it also explains why no
matter how much memory you add to a system it will usually end up
having almost zero "free" memory after doing a modest amount of
I/O. If your user-space applications aren't using that memory then
your kernel probably is. The downside of this approach is that this
"free" memory can be taken away from the kernel the moment a
user-space application decides it needs to allocate more memory for
itself. The kernel has no choice but to relinquish it, losing whatever
buffers may have been there.</p>

<p>So what does all of this mean for Graphite? We just highlighted
<code>carbon</code>'s reliance on consistently low I/O latency and we also know
that the write system call only returns quickly because the data is
merely being copied into a buffer. What happens when there is not
enough memory for the kernel to continue buffering writes? The writes
become synchronous and thus terribly slow! This causes a dramatic drop
in the rate of <code>carbon</code>'s write operations, which causes <code>carbon</code>'s queues
to grow, which eats up even more memory, starving the kernel even
further. In the end, this kind of situation usually results in <code>carbon</code>
running out of memory or being killed by an angry sysadmin.</p>

<p>To avoid this kind of catastrophe, I added several features to <code>carbon</code>
including configurable limits on how many data points can be queued
and rate-limits on how quickly various <code>whisper</code> operations can be
performed.  These features can protect <code>carbon</code> from spiraling out of
control and instead impose less harsh effects like dropping some data
points or refusing to accept more data points. However, proper values
for those settings are system-specific and require a fair amount of
testing to tune. They are useful but they do not fundamentally solve
the problem.  For that, we'll need more hardware.</p>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>7.9. Clustering</h2>

<p>Making multiple Graphite servers appear to be a single system from
a user perspective isn't terribly difficult, at least for a na&iuml;ve
implementation.  The webapp's user interaction primarily consists of
two operations: finding metrics and fetching data points (usually in
the form of a graph). The find and fetch operations of the webapp are
tucked away in a library that abstracts their implementation from the
rest of the codebase, and they are also exposed through HTTP request
handlers for easy remote calls.</p>

<p>The <code>find</code> operation searches the local filesystem of <code>whisper</code>
data for things matching a user-specified pattern, just as a filesystem
glob like <code>*.txt</code> matches files with that extension.
Being a tree structure, the result returned by <code>find</code> is a
collection of <code>Node</code> objects, each deriving from either the <code>Branch</code> or
<code>Leaf</code> sub-classes of <code>Node</code>. Directories correspond to branch nodes and
<code>whisper</code> files correspond to leaf nodes.  This layer of abstraction
makes it easy to support different types of underlying storage
including RRD files<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-5">5</a></sup> and gzipped <code>whisper</code> files.</p>

<p>The <code>Leaf</code> interface defines a <code>fetch</code> method whose
implementation depends on the type of leaf node. In the case of
<code>whisper</code> files it is simply a thin wrapper around the <code>whisper</code> library's
own fetch function.  When clustering support was added, the
<code>find</code> function was extended to be able to make remote find calls
via HTTP to other Graphite servers specified in the webapp's
configuration. The node data contained in the results of these HTTP
calls gets wrapped as <code>RemoteNode</code> objects which conform to the usual
<code>Node</code>, <code>Branch</code>, and <code>Leaf</code> interfaces. This makes the clustering
transparent to the rest of the webapp's codebase. The <code>fetch</code>
method for a remote leaf node is implemented as another HTTP call to
retrieve the data points from the node's Graphite server.</p>

<p>All of these calls are made between the webapps the same way a client
would call them, except with one additional parameter specifying that
the operation should only be performed locally and not be
redistributed throughout the cluster.  When the webapp is asked to
render a graph, it performs the <code>find</code> operation to locate the
requested metrics and calls <code>fetch</code> on each to retrieve their
data points. This works whether the data is on the local server,
remote servers, or both. If a server goes down, the remote calls
timeout fairly quickly and the server is marked as being out of
service for a short period during which no further calls to it will be
made. From a user standpoint, whatever data was on the lost server
will be missing from their graphs unless that data is duplicated on
another server in the cluster.</p>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>7.9.1. A Brief Analysis of Clustering Efficiency</h3>

<p>The most expensive part of a graphing request is rendering the graph.
Each rendering is performed by a single server so adding more servers
does effectively increase capacity for rendering graphs. However, the
fact that many requests end up distributing <code>find</code> calls to every
other server in the cluster means that our clustering scheme is
sharing much of the front-end load rather than dispersing it.  What we
have achieved at this point, however, is an effective way to
distribute back-end load, as each <code>carbon</code> instance operates
independently.  This is a good first step since most of the time the
back end is a bottleneck far before the front end is, but clearly the
front end will not scale horizontally with this approach.</p>

<p>In order to make the front end scale more effectively, the number of
remote <code>find</code> calls made by the webapp must be reduced. Again,
the easiest solution is caching. Just as memcached is already used to
cache data points and rendered graphs, it can also be used to cache
the results of <code>find</code> requests.  Since the location of metrics is
much less likely to change frequently, this should typically be cached
for longer. The trade-off of setting the cache timeout for <code>find</code>
results too long, though, is that new metrics that have been added to
the hierarchy may not appear as quickly to the user.</p>

</div>

<div class="subsect">
<h3>7.9.2. Distributing Metrics in a Cluster</h3>

<p>The Graphite webapp is rather homogeneous throughout a cluster, in
that it performs the exact same job on each server. <code>carbon</code>'s role,
however, can vary from server to server depending on what data you
choose to send to each instance. Often there are many different
clients sending data to <code>carbon</code>, so it would be quite annoying to
couple each client's configuration with your Graphite cluster's
layout. Application metrics may go to one <code>carbon</code> server, while
business metrics may get sent to multiple <code>carbon</code> servers for
redundancy.</p>

<p>To simplify the management of scenarios like this, Graphite comes with
an additional tool called <code>carbon-relay</code>. Its job is quite simple;
it receives metric data from clients exactly like the standard <code>carbon</code>
daemon (which is actually named <code>carbon-cache</code>) but instead of storing
the data, it applies a set of rules to the metric names to determine
which <code>carbon-cache</code> servers to relay the data to. Each rule consists of
a regular expression and a list of destination servers. For each data
point received, the rules are evaluated in order and the first rule
whose regular expression matches the metric name is used. This way all
the clients need to do is send their data to the <code>carbon-relay</code> and it
will end up on the right servers.</p>

<p>In a sense <code>carbon-relay</code> provides replication functionality, though it
would more accurately be called input duplication since it does not
deal with synchronization issues. If a server goes down temporarily,
it will be missing the data points for the time period in which it was
down but otherwise function normally. There are administrative scripts
that leave control of the re-synchronization process in the hands of
the system administrator.</p>

</div>

</div>

<div class="sect">
<h2>7.10. Design Reflections</h2>

<p>My experience in working on Graphite has reaffirmed a belief of mine
that scalability has very little to do with low-level performance but
instead is a product of overall design. I have run into many
bottlenecks along the way but each time I look for improvements in
design rather than speed-ups in performance. I have been asked many
times why I wrote Graphite in Python rather than Java or C++, and my
response is always that I have yet to come across a true need for the
performance that another language could offer. In
[<a href="bib1.html#bib:knuth:goto">Knu74</a>], Donald Knuth famously said that premature
optimization is the root of all evil.  As long as we assume that our
code will continue to evolve in non-trivial ways then all
optimization<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-6">6</a></sup> is in some sense premature.</p>

<p>One of Graphite's greatest strengths and greatest weaknesses is the
fact that very little of it was actually "designed" in the
traditional sense.  By and large Graphite evolved gradually, hurdle by
hurdle, as problems arose. Many times the hurdles were foreseeable and
various pre-emptive solutions seemed natural. However it can be useful
to avoid solving problems you do not actually have yet, even if it
seems likely that you soon will. The reason is that you can learn much
more from closely studying actual failures than from theorizing about
superior strategies.  Problem solving is driven by both the empirical
data we have at hand and our own knowledge and intuition. I've found
that doubting your own wisdom sufficiently can force you to look at
your empirical data more thoroughly.</p>

<p>For example, when I first wrote <code>whisper</code> I was convinced that it would
have to be rewritten in C for speed and that my Python implementation
would only serve as a prototype. If I weren't under a time-crunch I
very well may have skipped the Python implementation entirely. It
turns out however that I/O is a bottleneck so much earlier than CPU
that the lesser efficiency of Python hardly matters at all in
practice.</p>

<p>As I said, though, the evolutionary approach is also a great weakness
of Graphite. Interfaces, it turns out, do not lend themselves well to
gradual evolution. A good interface is consistent and employs
conventions to maximize predictability. By this measure, Graphite's
URL API is currently a sub-par interface in my opinion. Options and
functions have been tacked on over time, sometimes forming small
islands of consistency, but overall lacking a global sense of
consistency. The only way to solve such a problem is through
versioning of interfaces, but this too has drawbacks. Once a new
interface is designed, the old one is still hard to get rid of,
lingering around as evolutionary baggage like the human appendix. It
may seem harmless enough until one day your code gets appendicitis
(i.e. a bug tied to the old interface) and you're forced to
operate. If I were to change one thing about Graphite early on, it
would have been to take much greater care in designing the external
APIs, thinking ahead instead of evolving them bit by bit.</p>

<p>Another aspect of Graphite that causes some frustration is the limited
flexibility of the hierarchical metric naming model. While it is quite
simple and very convenient for most use cases, it makes some
sophisticated queries very difficult, even impossible, to
express. When I first thought of creating Graphite I knew from the
very beginning that I wanted a human-editable URL API for creating
graphs<sup class="footnote"><a href="#footnote-7">7</a></sup>. While I'm still glad that Graphite provides this today,
I'm afraid this requirement has burdened the API with excessively
simple syntax that makes complex expressions unwieldy.  A hierarchy
makes the problem of determining the "primary key" for a metric
quite simple because a path is essentially a primary key for a node in
the tree. The downside is that all of the descriptive data (i.e.
column data) must be embedded directly in the path. A potential
solution is to maintain the hierarchical model and add a separate
metadata database to enable more advanced selection of metrics with a
special syntax.</p>

<h2>7.11. Becoming Open Source</h2>

<p>Looking back at the evolution of Graphite, I am still surprised both by
how far it has come as a project and by how far it has taken me as a
programmer. It started as a pet project that was only a few hundred
lines of code. The rendering engine started as an experiment, simply
to see if I could write one. <code>whisper</code> was written over the course of a
weekend out of desperation to solve a show-stopper problem before a
critical launch date. <code>carbon</code> has been rewritten more times than I care
to remember. Once I was allowed to release Graphite under an open
source license in 2008 I never really expected much response. After a
few months it was mentioned in a CNET article that got picked up by
Slashdot and the project suddenly took off and has been active ever
since.  Today there are dozens of large and mid-sized companies using
Graphite. The community is quite active and
continues to grow. Far from being a finished product, there is a lot
of cool experimental work being done, which keeps it fun to work on
and full of potential.</p>

because they can contain multiple data sources; an RRD data source
is a leaf node.</li>
<li id="footnote-6">Knuth specifically meant low-level code
optimization, not macroscopic optimization such as design
improvements.</li>
<li id="footnote-7">This forces the graphs themselves to be open
source. Anyone can simply look at a graph's URL to understand it or
modify it.</li>
